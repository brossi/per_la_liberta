"""Atomic file I/O — ported from utils.atomic_write_json (utils.py:332-341).

The atomic write (temp file + os.replace) is how every sidecar in the pipeline is
written; reproducing it byte-for-byte keeps the engine's outputs diffable against the
committed live artifacts (indent=2, ensure_ascii=False). Atomicity is also the load-bearing
assumption under invariant I8 / the I2 residual: a *present* artifact is never half-written, so
a sibling step that reads it may treat a parse failure as bug-class. Every artifact a later
step consumes must therefore be written through one of these helpers — the JSON sidecars via
``atomic_write_json``, the plain-text witnesses (OCR copies, stitched text) via
``atomic_write_text`` — never a raw ``Path.write_text``/``open(...)`` (enforced by
``tests/unit/test_atomic_writes.py``).
