"""The L1 ``Atom`` model — immutable, addressed capture units (ENGINE_STRUCTURE_PLAN §3.0/§3.2).

An atom is one captured unit of source text carrying a *durable address*: a raw codepoint span +
the hash of the raw witness text it addresses, a page/scan range, an optional word-box geometry,
and a normalization-layer label. Nothing downstream recomputes these from mutated text, so an atom
stays addressable across every later stage. Identity is ``atom_id`` (text evidence + coordinates),
deliberately distinct from the structural ``node_id`` minted at L2.

Two stream flavours share this one type (§11.1): a **per-witness** atom names its ``witness`` and
carries that witness's own geometry; a **canonical** (reconciled) atom has no single witness and
instead back-links through ``derived_from`` to the per-witness atoms it was reconciled from.

``geom`` (D30) is the part S1.1 *freezes the shape of*: the primary re-binding signal and the base
layer for space reconstruction. Its slot is Optional, and **absence is a first-class state — never
invented coordinates.** One witness flavour (Gemini-vision text) has no word-box layer at all, and
because the boxes come from a *different* OCR pass than the witness text, a box is not a fact about
that text until a matcher proves it — so every present box records its match-provenance
(``geometry_engine`` / ``matched_witness_id`` / ``match_method`` / ``match_confidence``). The
matcher (S2.1) writes into this slot and S4.4's schema reads it, so the field *set* is locked here.

Pure core: no language, ordinal, or book-structure opinion lives here — capture classes and witness
names are caller-supplied strings (the S0.2 neutrality guard scans this module).
