"""S1.5 — the persisted L1 atom store (ENGINE_STRUCTURE_PLAN §3.5/§3.6/§11.1; D21).

S1.3a builds the per-witness atom streams + the canonical reconciled projection in memory; S1.4
proves a single-witness stream reconstructs its source byte-exact. This module makes those streams
**durable**: one JSON file per stream under ``books/<id>/work/data/atoms/`` (§11.1), each carrying an
**independent** schema version and stale class (M3) so a lineage stale-check can name *which* layer
changed and route the right migration (§3.6). It is the read/write path S1.4's closure and every L2
consumer (S10.2) reach the atoms through — never a private helper, never re-reading the raw witness.

Three guarantees, the S1.5 done-when (PLAN §9):

- **Serialization-invariance.** :func:`to_json` / :func:`from_json` round-trip an :class:`AtomStream`
  byte-for-byte — every addressing field (``raw_span``, ``raw_source_hash``, ``geom``,
  ``derived_from``), not just ``text``, and the per-witness :class:`~engine.structure.roundtrip_gate.GapRecord`
  stream. ``load_stream(save_stream(s)) == s``.
- **Two-tier round-trip self-check on load.** *(a) Whole-artifact anchor* — a witness stream persists
  its inter-atom **gap records** *and* a ``source_hash`` (the hash of the true witness source it tiles,
  fixed at capture); :func:`assert_stream_roundtrip` rebuilds the source from stored atom + gap **text**
  and checks its hash against that anchor. Persisting the gap *bytes* is load-bearing — gap whitespace
  is *not* recoverable from span widths (a width-N gap is any mix of spaces / tabs / newlines), so an
  atoms-only store could not rebuild the witness without re-reading the raw file (the back-door S1.4
  forbids) and would round-trip **vacuously** green on PLL's newline-only copies (S1.4 5-lens audit,
  carried decision). *(b) Per-atom address check* — :func:`assert_atom_hashes` checks each atom's
  ``hash_raw(text) == raw_source_hash`` (otherwise the persisted per-atom hash is *inert* at load). It
  catches what the anchor cannot: a **compensated drift** (bytes moved across an atom boundary, leaving
  the concatenation — and the anchor — unchanged), and corruption of a **canonical** atom (which has no
  whole-artifact anchor, so this is its only load-time text tier). Both run in :func:`load_stream`.
- **Reference-integrity.** :func:`assert_reference_integrity` checks every canonical atom derives from
  ≥1 witness (the S1.3a property, never vacuously zero) and that every ``derived_from`` back-link
  resolves to a real atom in the named witness stream, else fails loud.

**Scope split, from S1.4's audit.** A *witness* stream tiles one source → it carries gaps + a
``source_hash`` and gets both round-trip tiers (anchor + per-atom). The *canonical* stream tiles no
single source (its atoms adopt their ``derived_from[0]`` witness's address, pointing into different
witness sources) → it carries **no** gaps and **no** ``source_hash``, so it skips the whole-artifact
anchor; its load-time integrity is the per-atom address check + reference-integrity here (+ the per-atom
S1.2 floor against each ``derived_from`` witness, elsewhere).

**Failure-mode split.** :class:`~engine.errors.StaleArtifactError` is the *load-boundary* contract:
:func:`from_json` returns a valid stream or raises it — a non-object document, a stale ``schema_version``,
wrong ``stale_class``, missing envelope key, a wrong-*typed* field (a ``TypeError`` from reconstruction),
or any deeper model ``ValueError`` is wrapped here; :func:`load_stream` also maps a non-JSON file to it.
The model's own ``__post_init__`` guards (an out-of-vocab ``processing_scope``, a half-built ``geom``, a
canonical stream handed gaps, a duplicate ``atom_id``) raise ``ValueError`` for an **in-memory** caller —
a programming error, not stale data. A persisted text/address drift is
:class:`~engine.errors.RoundTripError`; a *missing* file is :class:`~engine.errors.MissingInputError`.

This departs from the §11.1 sketch's bare JSON *array* by design: the envelope header (version, stale
class, the witness ``source_hash`` + gap stream) is exactly what the carried S1.4 decision requires for
a non-back-door, non-vacuous store. Pure persistence of neutral atoms: no language, ordinal, or
book-structure opinion lives here (the S0.2 neutrality guard scans this module) — stream ids and capture
classes are caller-supplied strings.

    The per-atom complement of :func:`assert_stream_roundtrip`'s whole-artifact anchor, and the tier
    that makes the persisted ``raw_source_hash`` actually load-bearing (it is otherwise *inert* at
    load). It catches two drifts the anchor cannot:

    - a **compensated drift** — bytes re-attributed across an atom boundary so the concatenation, and
      thus the anchor, is unchanged (the anchor checks the whole reconstruction, not each atom);
    - a corrupted **canonical** atom — canonical streams have no whole-artifact anchor, so this is
      their only load-time text-integrity tier.

    Relies on the store's raw/verbatim-text invariant (``text`` *is* the raw slice the span addresses,
    so ``hash_raw(text) == raw_source_hash`` by construction) — the same invariant the anchor assumes;
    a future normalized layer (S3), where ``text`` diverges from the raw slice, revisits both together.
