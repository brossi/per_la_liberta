"""Persisted structure-substrate artifacts: where each lives in the work tree, and the
independent schema version each carries.

The document-structure substrate writes three durable artifacts under a book's
``BookWorkspace`` (``books/<id>/work/``), one per layer of the L1→L2→L3 model
(ENGINE_STRUCTURE_PLAN §3.2):

- **atom store** — per-witness + canonical L1 atom streams, under ``data/atoms/*.json`` (§11.1);
- **structure map** — B's durable container/projection catalogue, ``structure_map.json`` at the
  work root (§11.2);
- **relation store** — the L3 graph + cross-language alignment, ``relations.json`` at the work
  root (§11.3).

Each layer is **independently versioned**: a schema change to one does not bump the others, so a
lineage stale-check can name *which* layer changed and route the right migration — three distinct
stale classes (ENGINE_STRUCTURE_TASKS M3; the stores land in S1.5 / S4.4 / S7.1c). This module is
the S0.1 skeleton: it fixes the locations and the version constants now; the stores, JSON schemas,
and lineage manifest that read them arrive with those later tasks.

Beyond the three persisted layers, this module also carries the **resource + normalization-policy
lineage** constants (S3.0): a schema version and two further stale classes (``resource-set``,
``normalization-policy``) that version the *inputs* — the profile-declared dictionaries and the
pre-lookup fold policy — rather than a persisted layer. They have no work-tree location of their
own; the lineage record holding them is embedded in the structure-map header (S4.4) and routed by
governance (S8.1) as repairs distinct from any layer's.

Engine-agnostic by construction: artifact *names* and *layout* only — no language, ordinal, or
book-structure opinion (the recognizer and the structure profile carry that, never this core).

#: on, and the discriminator a persisted stream's envelope declares so a load can reject a file that
#: is structurally JSON but not an atom store. Distinct from the structure-map (B) and relation-store
#: (C) classes, so a schema change to one names *which* layer changed (§3.6). Bound by S1.5.

# --- resource + normalization-policy lineage (S3.0) ------------------------------------- #

#: Schema version of the resource/normalizer lineage record (``ResourceLineage`` — structure/lineage.py).
#: Independent of the three persisted-layer versions above: S4.4 embeds this record in the
#: structure-map header, and a change to its shape bumps only this constant. Bound by S3.0.
RESOURCE_LINEAGE_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1
#: Stale class for the *resource set* — the frequency dictionary + the period dictionaries resolved
#: through the language profile. A content change (member swap/add/remove, re-OCR, ``oracle_min``)
#: trips this class so the lineage governance (S8.1) routes the *re-segment* repair. Distinct from
#: the normalizer class below and from every persisted-layer class. Bound by S3.0.
RESOURCE_STALE_CLASS = "resource-set"
#: Stale class for the *normalization policy* — the pre-lookup fold (case + accent) built from the
#: profile. A policy change trips this class so S8.1 routes the *re-derive offsets* repair, a
#: different migration from a resource swap (§3.6). Distinct from the resource class above and from
#: every persisted-layer class. Bound by S3.0.
