"""S1.3b — typed projection over the raw atoms (ENGINE_STRUCTURE_PLAN §2-A; R3/D5, §9).

Concern A's second behavior. S1.3a captures a raw witness into a flat, source-ordered, addressed
atom stream; this module *types* that stream via an injectable ``BlockClassifier`` (the S0.4 seam →
the S9 recognizer), producing a flat **typed** stream. Each :class:`TypedAtom` pairs one immutable
:class:`~engine.structure.atoms.Atom` with the classifier's
:class:`~engine.structure.classify.BlockClassification` — its ``block_class``, the ``typed_by``
provenance, and the ``confidence`` B weighs when it re-types. Typing is the book-specific,
*correctable* step (R3/D5): B may re-atomize and re-type, not merely re-group, so every typed atom
records **who** typed it, never an anonymous label.

**Profile-scoped completeness (§9 — "never a degenerate green").** ``unknown``
(:data:`~engine.structure.classify.UNKNOWN`) is the engine's first-class *incomplete* state, not a
real class. Only **processed** atoms are in scope — those **not** ``processing_scope``-excluded:
furniture and wrappers are captured-with-role and *excluded* downstream (§3.0), so an excluded atom
left ``unknown`` is out of scope — never routed to review, never a hard-fail. (The filter is
``!= excluded`` — "process everything not opted out"; the scope vocabulary is closed at the ``Atom``
model, S1.1, so a stray value fails at construction, never here.) Whether a *processed* ``unknown``
atom
is fatal is the profile's call, scoped by its declared ``boundary_classes`` set (S9.1; passed in as
**data**, never a literal here, so the core stays book-agnostic). The discriminator is the atom's L1
``capture_provenance_class`` — the structural slot the bytes were captured into — matched against
``boundary_classes``:

  - an ``unknown`` atom whose ``capture_provenance_class`` **is** a declared boundary class →
    **hard-fail** (:class:`~engine.errors.IncompleteTypingError`): a structurally load-bearing slot
    the typing could not resolve breaks the skeleton, so it must be loud, never routed quietly.
  - an ``unknown`` atom in a **body leaf** (capture class not in ``boundary_classes``) → **route to
    review**: recorded with count + location in the returned :class:`CompletenessReport`, not
    raised. A partial result whose structure-bearing atoms are all resolved is *reviewable*, not
    broken.
  - an **all-unknown** processed set → **hard-fail** regardless of boundary classes: a projection
    that resolved *nothing* is degenerate-incomplete (exactly the S0.4 stub's output), never a quiet
    green that "passed".

**The boundary hard-fail is a mechanism + a forward contract, not yet a real-input guarantee.** It
keys on ``capture_provenance_class``, the only per-atom axis *independent* of the typed
``block_class`` (an atom is never both ``block_class in boundary_classes`` **and**
``block_class == UNKNOWN``). But today's S1.3a capture tags every non-furniture line with one body
class (``capture_witness``'s ``body_class``, default ``"body"``) and forces every *named*
``classify_line`` result to ``processing_scope="excluded"`` — so no real capture stream yet carries
an *included* boundary class. Until S9 makes capture granular (tagging heading / footnote-call /
embedded-letter-boundary lines with their own included ``capture_provenance_class``, which requires
relaxing that capture.py coupling), a real boundary left ``unknown`` is captured as the body class
and **routes to review** rather than hard-failing — surfaced for a human, not silently passed. (This
"routes to review, not silent" holds *because* ``classify_line``'s contract is furniture-only, so a
heading stays a body atom and is reviewable. A binding that *mis-used* ``classify_line`` to tag a
heading would get it ``excluded`` and *then* silently exempt — the reason S9 must add an *included*
boundary capture class, not route boundaries through the furniture path.) A heading recognizer
already exists in the live tree (a ported regex); the branch is dead today by **capture-scope
choice**, not because nothing could identify a boundary. It is exercised here by synthetic fixtures
and is ready for the day capture supplies included boundary classes. (A profile declaring a real
block class literally named ``"unknown"`` would alias the sentinel — guarded at S9.1 profile-load,
where the full class vocabulary is visible, not here.)

The returned report **feeds a review / governance surface; the exact consumer is unsettled.** The
done-when names "the S6 truth-table machinery", but S6.2 computes behavioral *flags* for *resolved
L2 nodes* from L2 provenance, whereas ``to_review`` queues *unresolved L1 atoms* keyed on L1
``capture_provenance_class`` — a different layer/axis/lifecycle, so the S8.1-style HITL stale/repair
report is the likelier home. ``CompletenessReport`` is the minimal local shape that later wiring
subsumes; it does **not** wire into S6 (unbuilt) or anything else today.

Pure core: ``boundary_classes`` is profile data the caller supplies; no language / ordinal /
book-structure literal lives here (the S0.2 neutrality guard scans this file).
