"""S1.3a — raw addressed capture (ENGINE_STRUCTURE_PLAN §2-A/§3.0/§11.1; D25, the F4 fix).

Concern A's first behavior: re-segment a raw witness into immutable, addressed L1 atoms, **plus**
one canonical reconciled projection that back-links the per-witness atoms it was built from. This is
deliberately *not* read-only from ``reconcile``: that step segments copy1/2/3 in memory and then
**discards** the per-witness streams, persisting only the merged ``reconciled_chapters.json`` + word
flags. So the per-witness streams are *re-built here* by re-running segmentation on the raw copies —
that algorithm is this module's deliverable (the F4 note in ENGINE_STRUCTURE_TASKS), and it is what
keeps every witness independently addressable for the L3 spans of S7.1b.

Three neutral primitives, no language/book opinion (the S0.2 neutrality guard scans this file):

- :func:`capture_witness` — line-aware segmentation of one witness into raw atoms that **tile** the
  source. A maximal run of consecutive non-blank *body* lines becomes one paragraph atom whose
  ``text`` is the **verbatim** raw slice ``source[start:end]`` (no ``rejoin_lines``/``collapse_spaces``
  — those are lossy, D30 — so the S1.2 round-trip floor holds by construction). *Furniture* lines
  (page markers, running heads) are split into their own atoms carrying a caller-supplied
  ``capture_provenance_class`` + ``processing_scope="excluded"`` — captured-with-role, never dropped.
  Which lines are furniture, and how a span maps to a page, are **injected** (``classify_line`` /
  ``page_of``): the page-marker grammar and the no-page-map case are source-noise conventions that
  live in the per-book binding, not here.
- :func:`build_canonical` — align two structural witnesses block-by-block and emit a canonical atom
  per aligned group, each carrying ``derived_from`` back-links to the per-witness atoms it covers
  (§11.1). It adopts the *primary* witness's text/address; word-level cross-witness reconciliation is
  ``reconcile``'s existing job, orthogonal to this structural projection.
- :func:`assert_capture_tiles` — the capture-completeness + span-topology floor (§9): atoms are
  in-bounds, ordered, non-overlapping, and every byte outside an atom is whitespace (no *silent
  loss*). Furniture is atoms here, so the gaps are pure inter-atom whitespace — the validator needs
  no furniture grammar and stays neutral. This is the invariant S1.4 promotes to the production gate.
