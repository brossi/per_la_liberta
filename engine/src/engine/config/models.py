"""Config dataclasses — the typed surface the orchestrator threads into steps.

These are *dumb data holders*: a faithful 1:1 transcription of the book/scan/language
constants the live pipeline hardcodes, reorganised per ``engine/docs/constant_inventory.md``
(the M1 acceptance checklist). They carry no behaviour and no field without an inventory
destination. ``loader.py`` builds them; steps read them.

``ResolvedConfig`` = ``BookManifest`` ⊕ ``LanguageProfile`` ⊕ ``SourceNoiseProfile`` ⊕
``TypefaceProfile`` (plan §"Config model"). Fields with an imminent consumer (``Structure``
and the validate-relevant ``LanguageProfile``/``SourceNoiseProfile`` fields feed M2's ``validate``)
are typed precisely; ``prompt_context`` stays a free dict because its keys are defined by the
prompt templates ported in M4, not knowable now.
