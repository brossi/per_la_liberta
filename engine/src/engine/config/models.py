"""Config dataclasses — the typed surface the orchestrator threads into steps.

These are *dumb data holders*: a faithful 1:1 transcription of the book/scan/language
constants the live pipeline hardcodes, reorganised per ``engine/docs/constant_inventory.md``
(the M1 acceptance checklist). They carry no behaviour and no field without an inventory
destination. ``loader.py`` builds them; steps read them.

``ResolvedConfig`` = ``BookManifest`` ⊕ ``LanguageProfile`` ⊕ ``SourceNoiseProfile`` ⊕
``TypefaceProfile`` (plan §"Config model"). Fields with an imminent consumer (``Structure``
and the validate-relevant ``LanguageProfile``/``SourceNoiseProfile`` fields feed M2's ``validate``)
are typed precisely; ``prompt_context`` stays a free dict because its keys are defined by the
prompt templates ported in M4, not knowable now.

    The word-quality fields (``english_markers``, ``skip_words``, ``consonant_alphabet``),

    ``validate``; ``word_score_accents`` feeds M3 reconcile's OCR word scorer; the period
    dictionaries + ``oracle_min`` feed the M6 membership oracle.

    ``display_name`` (the human-readable language name, e.g. ``"Italian"``) and
    ``accent_inventory`` (the accented characters a prompt asks the model to preserve) are the
    cross-title language facts the M4 prompt templates render as ``{{ language.* }}`` — distinct
    from book identity (``{{ book.* }}`` from ``manifest.prompt_context``). ``display_name``
    replaces the per-book ``prompt_context.language_name`` the live OCR prompt baked in, so a
    language fact can no longer vary book-to-book (BR-008). ``accent_inventory`` is a
    prompt-display set, deliberately separate from ``word_score_accents`` (the scorer's set,
    which mixes case) and ``coverage.letters`` (char-coverage's set).

    The three M4b-D1 fields keep cleanup's *step code* free of any Italian character literal —
    every accent/letter set it parameterises on is sourced here, not baked (the BR-002 code-
    neutrality half; proven by ``test_cleanup_neutrality``):
      - ``accent_fold`` — the fixed accent→base translation cleanup folds with (``{"from","to"}``
        parallel strings → ``str.maketrans``). Deliberately the verbatim live ``_ACCENT_MAP``, NOT
        ``util.text.strip_accents`` (NFKD): the two diverge on non-Italian glyphs (``ç``/``ñ``) a
        foreign name could surface, which would move the detcore golden.
      - ``accented_letters`` — the presumed-canonical superset of the language's accented letters,
        used wherever cleanup's regexes enumerate "a real accented letter" (the live code spelled a
        slightly different restrictive subset at each site; the superset is golden-validated, so any
        site where it changes output turns the golden red rather than passing silently).
      - ``word_letter_class`` — the permissive "any word letter" regex char-class fragment
        (``a-zA-ZÀ-ÿ``) cleanup's tokenisation regexes use. A *script* fact (a non-Latin book needs
        a different class), so config not code — the one documented exception to ``CoverageSpec``'s
        no-regex rule, because its consumer is a compiled regex, not a membership set.

    """How the *source scan* degrades — the OCR-noise fingerprint of the typeface the
    original book was printed in (e.g. a face that blurs ``c`` and ``e``).

    This is an **input** concern: it drives cleanup's correction of OCR errors, and has
    nothing to do with how the *edition* is rendered (that is ``TypefaceProfile``). The
    engine ships no opinion here — a book supplies the noise profile matching its own scan.

    ``page_marker_artifact_pattern`` is read by M2 ``validate``; the substitution tables,
    ``noise_line_patterns``, ``ligature_substitutions`` and ``page_marker_format`` are consumed
    by reconcile/cleanup in M3–M4b.

    The five fields cleanup reads keep its *step code* free of any source-noise literal — every
    OCR-noise pattern it parameterises on is sourced here, not baked (the BR-002/refinement-#4
    relocation; proven by ``test_cleanup_neutrality``):
      - ``noise_line_patterns`` — full-line OCR-decoration regexes; a line matching ANY is dropped
        (``is_noise_line`` :234/:248/:251). The M4b singular ``noise_line_pattern`` folded into this
        list, joined by the separator + ``Disp.``-furniture patterns; per-pattern flags ride inline
        (e.g. ``(?i)``).
      - ``page_marker_line_pattern`` — the compound page-marker noise class (``is_noise_line`` :241);
        the surrounding len/real-word/has-digit guard stays in code.
      - ``char_substitutions`` — ``[regex, replacement]`` confusions whose *replacement* is
        typeface/language opinion (``£→E``, a source-scan misread of a capital E). Distinct from
        the next field, which deletes noise (a neutral space, decided in code).
      - ``inline_page_marker_patterns`` — mid-text page-marker artifact regexes cleanup removes
        (cleanup.py :601-603).

    Note (BR-007): the substitution fields are three different *kinds*. ``boundary_substitutions``
    is a language-neutral *character-confusion* model (``i→r/e``), applied generatively and
    dictionary-validated. ``ligature_substitutions`` is likewise a generative, dictionary-validated
    char-confusion (``fi``→``u``/``n``/``ri`` etc.) but for the typeface's ligatures. ``substitution_rules``
    are *literal* garble→word pairs that bake a character confusion together with a specific Italian
    word (``eolla→colla``) — so they are language-bound, not pure typeface. Factoring the
    char-confusion part into a layered {general + per-typeface} model is deferred (BR-007) until a
    2nd typeface/language exists.
