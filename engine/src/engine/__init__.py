"""book-engine — a book/language-agnostic OCR → reconcile → clean → translate →
typeset framework.

Forked (deliberately, one-way) from the source translation pipeline at the parent
repo root. Every book/language/scan-specific constant leaves the core and lives in
a per-book manifest + shared profiles; the core reads ``cfg`` (ResolvedConfig) and
the active ``LanguagePlugin`` only. See ENGINE_FRAMEWORK_PLAN.md for the staged
build (M0–M7). Steps are ported milestone by milestone; an unported step module is a
scaffold stub whose ``run`` raises ``NotImplementedError`` naming the milestone that
ports it.
