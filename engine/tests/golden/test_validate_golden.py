"""Golden reproduction — the engine ``validate`` step, run on the frozen PLL inputs, must
reproduce the report the live ``validate.py`` produced (frozen by
``_generate_validate_fixture.py``), modulo the one documented label generalisation
(``italian_char_coverage`` → ``char_coverage``).

This loads the real spaCy model (word_quality's NER pass) — asserted *hard*, never skipped:
a missing model is a real configuration error (``uv sync --extra it``), and a skip here would
hide a broken word-quality port until it shipped. The report is also asserted to land inside
the workspace, never the live tree.
