"""Sidecar contract basics for ``chapter_start_pages.json``.

This is the one hand-curated sidecar that is already a live M1 input (typeset reads it; no
code writes it), so it is where the sidecar-contracts track starts. The richer per-step
schemas the plan envisions (``review_flags``, ``triage_resolved``, ``source_pages`` …) land
with the steps that *produce* them in M3–M5 — writing them now, before a producer exists,
would be schema-without-a-consumer.

The contracts here are the ones that would actually catch a corrupted or drifted sidecar:
the page-offset arithmetic, agreement with the manifest's declared leaf offset, and that
every content-chapter id resolves to a real chapter in the text (the parse_md namespace).
