"""S1.3a — raw addressed capture, the model-level floor (ENGINE_STRUCTURE_PLAN §2-A/§3.0/§11.1; D25).

Synthetic, in-memory witnesses exercise the three neutral primitives of ``structure.capture`` and the
S1.3a done-when properties: a witness segments into a stream of raw atoms that *tile* the source with
furniture captured-with-role (not dropped); a canonical projection built from two witnesses gives
**every canonical atom ≥1 witness derivation**. The real-PLL-bytes floor is ``test_raw_capture_real_input``.

Red-first (PLAN §9): the tiling floor (:func:`assert_capture_tiles`) is exercised positive **and** by
three tampered negatives that share it as a chokepoint (overlap / out-of-bounds / silent loss), so a
weakened check reds at least one. The capture/round-trip coupling is pinned by reconstructing each
atom through the S1.2 floor — drop the hash and a wrong slice would pass capture but red the round-trip.
The canonical-derivation property is asserted over *every* aligned shape (match / primary-only /
secondary-only), so an alignment branch that dropped a derivation reds the headline.
