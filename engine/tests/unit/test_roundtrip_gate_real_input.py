"""S1.4 — the production round-trip GATE on REAL PLL bytes (ENGINE_STRUCTURE_PLAN §3.0/§9; D22).

``test_roundtrip_gate`` is the synthetic floor; this runs the **same gate** over the committed PLL
witnesses (``books/per_la_liberta/inputs/copy{1,2,3}_raw.txt``) — the real-input promotion the row
calls for. The crux S1.4 adds over the S1.2 per-atom floor and the S1.3a tiling floor:

1. **Whole-artifact byte-exactness.** Each whole witness (~520K–790K codepoints) is reconstructed
   byte-for-byte from its S1.3a atom stream + the explicit gap records — coverage the per-atom hashes
   never pin (they re-slice the source, so they cannot see an ``atom.text`` drifted off its span;
   ``test_real_text_drift_*`` proves exactly that on real bytes).
2. **The wholesale-exclusion seam** (deferred from S1.3b): on copy3's real page-marker furniture the
   processed atoms clear the floor with room to spare, yet a capture that mis-tags every atom excluded
   raises — the failure no tiling/round-trip/completeness tier otherwise sees.

The copy3 ``⟨PAGE:N⟩`` furniture grammar is a per-book source-noise convention supplied **here**, never
in ``structure/`` core (the S0.2 neutrality guard scans the core, not this PLL-bound test). The gate is
page-agnostic, so ``page_of`` is left default — only the furniture ``classify_line`` matters.

Tiers (each proven red): round-trip (whole witness reconstructs byte-exact) + negative (real overlap,
real text-drift, real implicit gap, real all-excluded each fail loud).
