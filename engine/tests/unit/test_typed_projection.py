"""S1.3b — typed projection over the raw atoms + profile-scoped completeness (ENGINE_STRUCTURE_TASKS).

S1.3a captures a raw witness into addressed atoms; S1.3b *types* that stream via an injectable
``BlockClassifier`` (S0.4 seam) and asserts **profile-scoped completeness** over the result. The
done-when (property tier): a boundary-class ``unknown`` raises; a body-leaf ``unknown`` routes to
review with count + location; an all-``unknown`` projection fails completeness (§9 — never a
degenerate green).

The discriminator between the two ``unknown`` regimes is the atom's L1 ``capture_provenance_class``
(the structural slot it was captured into) matched against the profile-supplied ``boundary_classes``
— it has to be an axis *independent* of the typed ``block_class``, because an atom can never be both
``block_class in boundary_classes`` **and** ``block_class == UNKNOWN``. ``boundary_classes`` is data
passed in, never a literal in core (the S0.2 neutrality guard scans ``structure/``).

Invariants (each proven red by a targeted SUT mutation — red-first, ENGINE_STRUCTURE_PLAN §9):
  - positional typing: ``typed_projection`` zips atoms↔classifications in order; same length —
    drop the zip-order / use a fixed list → ``test_typed_projection_pairs_in_source_order`` reds.
  - seam-contract count: a classifier returning the wrong count raises (no silent tail-drop) —
    delete the length guard → ``test_typed_projection_rejects_count_mismatch`` reds.
  - degenerate hard-fail: an all-``unknown`` projection raises **even with no boundary classes** —
    remove the all-unknown branch → ``test_all_unknown_projection_is_degenerate_failure`` reds.
  - boundary hard-fail: a boundary-class ``unknown`` raises and is distinct from the degenerate
    case (the projection has resolved atoms) — remove the boundary branch →
    ``test_boundary_class_unknown_hard_fails`` reds; it routes to review instead.
  - body-leaf route-to-review: a body ``unknown`` does **not** raise and is reported with count +
    location — drop the routed items (empty the review list) →
    ``test_body_leaf_unknown_routes_to_review`` reds (count/location lost).
  - keyed on UNKNOWN, not membership: a *resolved* boundary-slot atom does not raise — widen the
    branch to "in boundary_classes" → ``test_resolved_boundary_atom_does_not_fail`` reds.
  - degenerate-before-boundary ordering: an all-unknown-with-a-boundary projection reports the
    degenerate cause — swap the order → ``test_degenerate_check_precedes_boundary_check`` reds.
  - furniture exemption: an EXCLUDED atom left ``unknown`` is out of scope (not routed, not a
    hard-fail) — drop the ``processing_scope`` filter → ``test_excluded_furniture_is_exempt_…`` reds.
  - degenerate ranges over PROCESSED atoms: an all-excluded (furniture-only) stream is vacuously
    complete, not degenerate — drop the ``processed and`` empty-guard →
    ``test_all_excluded_stream_is_vacuously_complete`` reds.

Audit-hardening invariants (5-lens adversarial pass; each mutation-proven red):
  - count guard catches too-MANY, not only too-few: ``!=``→``<`` → ``…rejects_too_many…`` reds.
  - ``processing_scope`` filter is ``!= excluded`` not ``== included``: an out-of-vocab scope stays
    in scope (no reopened degenerate green) — revert to the whitelist →
    ``test_out_of_vocabulary_processing_scope_stays_in_scope`` reds.
  - ``boundary_classes`` rejects a bare ``str`` (char-set trap): drop the guard →
    ``test_boundary_classes_rejects_a_bare_str`` reds.
  - route-to-review "count + location" bound above cardinality 1: cap to first →
    ``test_multiple_body_leaf_unknowns_are_all_routed_with_locations`` reds.
  - boundary failure names ALL offenders: clamp the list →
    ``test_multiple_boundary_unknowns_are_all_named_in_the_failure`` reds.

Real-path binding (the reviewer's gap): three tests run ``capture_witness → typed_projection →
check_completeness`` on production-shaped atoms (``test_real_capture_stream_is_degenerate_under_the_stub``,
``test_excluded_furniture_is_exempt_…``, ``test_all_excluded_stream_…``), not only on the synthetic
``capture_provenance_class="heading"`` shape S1.3a cannot emit. The boundary hard-fail itself stays
synthetic-only by necessity: no real classifier yet resolves a body atom while leaving a sibling
*included* boundary atom ``unknown`` — that capability is S9 (see ``typed.py`` module docstring).

Canonical-stream + R3/D5 coverage: the typed projection also runs over the **canonical**
(``build_canonical``) stream B/L2 consume (``test_typed_projection_runs_over_the_canonical_stream``);
the override-relevant data survives (``…preserves_typed_by_and_confidence`` — mutation-proven by
clobbering ``confidence``); and re-typing is a new projection over the same untouched frozen atoms
(``test_retyping_is_a_new_projection_over_untouched_atoms`` — the R3/D5 correctability affordance).
