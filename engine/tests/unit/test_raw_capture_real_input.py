"""S1.3a — raw addressed capture on REAL PLL bytes (ENGINE_STRUCTURE_PLAN §2-A/§3.0/§11.1; D25, F4).

The model floor (``test_raw_capture``) runs on synthetic text. This is the real-input slice: it runs
``structure.capture`` against the *committed* PLL witnesses (``books/per_la_liberta/inputs/copy{1,2,3}_raw.txt``)
and copy3's page map, with the PLL ``⟨PAGE:N⟩`` page-marker grammar supplied **here**, never in core —
the copy3 source-noise convention lives in this per-book binding (the S0.2 neutrality guard scans
``structure/``, not this test).

What real bytes verify that synthetic cannot:

1. **Capture completeness on the whole witness** — copy3 segments into body paragraphs + page-marker
   furniture that **tile the witness with zero silent loss**: every one of ~790K codepoints is inside
   an atom span or inter-atom whitespace. The furniture count is bound to an *independent* regex over
   the witness (two computations of "how many markers" must agree), so a segmenter that swallowed a
   marker into a body atom reds. This is the capture-completeness invariant S1.4 promotes to a gate.
2. **Page attribution at scale** — copy3 is the only page-addressable witness: every body atom lands
   on a real page and each ``⟨PAGE:N⟩`` furniture atom carries ``(N, N)``; copy1/copy2 (0 form-feeds,
   no map) carry :data:`~engine.structure.PAGE_UNMAPPED` throughout.
3. **The canonical projection over real divergence** — aligning the full copy1/copy2 streams (~3.6K vs
   ~3.4K paragraphs of independently-OCR'd text) yields a canonical stream where **every atom has ≥1
   witness derivation** (the S1.3a done-when), ~46% link both witnesses, ids are unique, and each atom
   round-trips byte-exact against its primary witness's source.

Tiers (each proven red, PLAN §9): completeness (``assert_capture_tiles`` over the real witness) +
negatives (a tampered overlap / silent loss on real bytes share that chokepoint). Each frozen count is
bound to an independent in-test oracle (S1.3a.3 — regex / blank-block split / opcode algebra) so a
segmenter regression reds the binding; the ints stay as legible scale anchors — **refresh them if the
witnesses/page map are regenerated.**

#   - furniture: genuinely cross-architecture — a regex *occurrence* count vs capture's line-classified
#     *atom* count; the two diverge exactly when a marker is welded into a body block (the probe risk).
#   - body / copy1 / copy2: implementation-independent (a regex blank-block split vs capture's stateful
#     line-walk) but specification-shared — catches a walk-implementation bug, not a shared spec error.
#   - canonical: independent of build_canonical's per-pair emission loop (the opcode->pair algebra),
#     recomputing only the alignment; catches a drop/dup in emission. The frozen scale anchor catches a
#     capture-segmentation drift the same-input algebra would otherwise track silently.
# A localized capture mutation is proven to red these bindings (PLAN §9). The copy3 body oracle masks
# furniture lines with the genuinely-independent furniture regex, so it inherits that independence on
