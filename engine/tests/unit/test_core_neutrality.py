"""Invariant I4 — core neutrality: the engine package carries no book-identity or typeface
opinion. Which book, which entities, which typeface are config (``books/<id>/manifest.json`` +
``profiles/``), never code — that is what lets the engine port to a second book by swapping
config, with no source edit (the M7 extraction premise).

This is the negative control whose absence let "Bodoni" survive in three core docstrings until a
manual grep caught it (scrubbed in c6790d6). A grep is a one-time act; this makes it a standing
guard that fails the moment a this-book / this-typeface term reappears in code *or* prose
(docstrings and comments included — that is exactly where the leak hid). The denylist is the
known-leak set, not a completeness proof; semantic leakage (a hardcoded chapter count, an
Italian-only assumption) is caught by config-extraction review, not this scan — see
``engine/docs/invariants.md`` (I4 residual risk).
