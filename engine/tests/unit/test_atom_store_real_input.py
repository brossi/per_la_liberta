"""S1.5 — the persisted atom store on REAL PLL bytes (ENGINE_STRUCTURE_PLAN §3.5/§3.6/§11.1; D21).

``test_atom_store`` is the synthetic floor; this persists and reloads the committed PLL witnesses
(``books/per_la_liberta/inputs/copy{1,2,3}_raw.txt``) + their canonical projection through the **same**
store, so the three tiers hold on real data:

1. **serialization-invariance** at scale — each whole witness stream (thousands of atoms + real
   inter-atom gaps) survives JSON + disk byte-for-byte (``load(save(s)) == s``);
2. **anchored round-trip** on real bytes — a persisted ``atom.text`` drifted off its span fails load;
3. **reference-integrity** — every ``derived_from`` back-link of the real canonical projection resolves
   to a real atom in the real witness streams.

The copy3 ``⟨PAGE:N⟩`` furniture grammar is the per-book source-noise binding, supplied here, never in
``structure/`` core (the S0.2 neutrality guard scans the core, not this PLL-bound test).
