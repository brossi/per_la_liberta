"""S1.2→S1.4 — the raw round-trip floor on REAL PLL bytes (ENGINE_STRUCTURE_PLAN §3.0/§9; D22).

S1.2's model floor (``test_roundtrip``) runs on synthetic in-memory text. This file is the first
slice of the **real-input floor (S1.4)**: it runs the same floor against the *committed* copy3
witness (``books/per_la_liberta/inputs/copy3_raw.txt``) and its page map. It is a *slice* of S1.4,
not the whole: the atoms here are built by hand from the page map, not produced by the S1.3a capture
stream through the public read path — that full path is still S1.4 (W2).

Two things real bytes verify that synthetic cannot:

1. **The byte-exact floor on the real witness** (round-trip + reference-integrity tiers). A frozen
   page (span + sha256 + verbatim head/tail, all committed literals derived from the fixture via an
   independent hash) binds three things at once — the witness bytes, ``hash_raw``'s algorithm, and
   the page map's offsets — so a drift in *any* reds the test (``feedback_validate_bindings``). The
   drift negative mutates the witness in-memory and asserts the floor raises.

2. **Capture completeness + span topology** (the reason S1.2 alone is "too weak" — PLAN risk table /
   DoD A-1). The probe behind this file found that copy3's page map covers 99.6% of the witness and
   the 0.4% remainder is *exactly* the ``⟨PAGE:N⟩`` delimiter furniture — no dropped book text. The
   topology check makes that a standing assertion: content spans are in-bounds, monotonic, and
   non-overlapping; the regex-found page-marker sequence equals the map's pages; and every uncovered
   char is marker-or-whitespace (zero silent loss). ``⟨PAGE:N⟩`` is a copy3/source-noise convention
   and lives only in this PLL-bound test, never in ``structure/`` core (the S0.2 neutrality guard).

Tiers (each proven red, PLAN §9): round-trip (the frozen page reconstructs byte-exact); negative
(witness drift raises; each topology branch raises on a tampered map — positive and negatives share
the ``assert_page_map_tiles_witness`` chokepoint, mirroring ``test_structure_tiers``'s
``_assert_version_binds``, so they cannot silently diverge). The completeness validator lives in the
test, not ``src/`` — the engine-side validator is S1.4/S1.5, not anticipated here.

Frozen literals refresh: re-derive from the fixture if the committed witness/page map is regenerated
(``scratchpad`` derivation probe; see the commit that added this file).
