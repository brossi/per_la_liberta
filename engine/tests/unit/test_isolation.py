"""Workspace containment, proven end-to-end — the forward-fork's core safety property.

``test_workspace`` proves the *guard* (``BookWorkspace.resolve`` rejects ``..``/absolute
escapes). This proves each *ported step uses it*: a real ``run`` writes only inside its
workspace and leaves every live PLL tree untouched — so the engine can never overwrite the
hand-tuned live edition. Snapshotting those trees before and after a run is the direct evidence
that ``run`` has no path to them. Each ported step earns a function here as it lands (validate
M2, reconcile M3, adjudicate M3).

The protected set is the *five* repo-root trees the engine must never write: the live
pipeline's ``data``/``output``/``state`` seam (``pipeline.py``) **plus** the published-edition
``docs``/``static`` (typeset's live targets, currently deploy-held). Even steps that only write
``ws.data`` are checked against all five — the guarantee is that *no* step can reach *any* live
tree, not merely the one it happens to use.

Containment is independent of what spaCy does (it is purely about *where* writes go), so the
validate case injects a no-op NER stub instead of loading the model, and adjudicate injects a
fake dictionary oracle. That keeps the safety check in the *fast* suite — run on every
invocation, not gated behind ``integration`` — while the real model/dictionary paths are
exercised by the golden and synthetic-book tests.
