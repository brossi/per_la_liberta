"""S3.0.6 (#28) — resource/normalizer neutrality guard (invariant 11).

The two S3.0 modules that turn the language profile's resources + fold policy into versions —
``dictionaries/normalization.py`` (the fold ops) and ``structure/lineage.py`` (the digest +
``ResourceLineage``) — are engine **core**: they read every dictionary path, frequency-file name, and
accent table from ``cfg.language``, baking none of them (``docs/s3_0_plan.md`` D-A/D-F, invariant 11).

The real protection is **behavioural** — ``test_resource_lineage`` invariant 10
(``test_synthetic_profile_breaks_on_any_bake``: a non-Latin, case-sensitive, non-Italian-accent
profile) and the ``fake_assets`` binding tests fail the moment a path/table is baked, regardless of
its spelling. This literal scan is **belt-and-suspenders** for the specific reintroduction the #27
pre-commit audit surfaced: the existing neutrality tiers glob these files but their denylists do not
cover *resource* identity. ``test_structure_neutrality`` forbids source-language **headings /
guillemets / part-counts** (and globs ``structure/lineage.py``); ``test_core_neutrality`` forbids the
book's **entities / typeface** (across all of core). **Neither** would catch a baked dictionary dir
(``zingarelli_1922``), the frequency filename (``it_combined.txt``), the source-language name, or an
Italian accent-fold literal in these two modules — so this scan adds that orthogonal axis. (The plan's
§11 named only ``normalization.py``; the #27 audit widened it to ``lineage.py`` too, since the same
gap applies there.)

Scope note: unlike the *language plugin* (which legitimately carries Italian-language opinion — its
job), these two modules are language-**neutral** core, so even a prose mention of the source language
is a leak here; the fix is to say "the source language", not name it. The denylist is the known-leak
set, not a completeness proof — a semantic bake with no literal (an Italian-only fold assumption
spelled neutrally) is caught by invariant 10, not this scan. A naive ``.lower()`` / ``[a-z]`` scan is
deliberately **excluded**: it false-positives on neutral code, and the case axis is already pinned
behaviourally (invariant 10) + by ``test_chunk_key_*`` in the battery.

Red-first (§9): ``test_no_resource_literal_in_the_s3_0_modules`` is green on the clean modules;
``test_guard_catches_a_planted_literal`` is the non-vacuity proof — it plants each forbidden term and
asserts the *same* scan flags it, so the guard is known to go red on a real reintroduction.
