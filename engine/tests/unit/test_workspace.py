"""``BookWorkspace`` — area derivation and the path-containment guarantee.

The containment assertion is the unit-level guarantee that the engine cannot write into
the live PLL tree: ``resolve``/``resolve_root`` must reject any ``..`` traversal, absolute
part, or symlink that escapes the work tree. (The fuller before/after-hash isolation test
arrives in M2, once a real step actually writes.)

Invariants (each proven red on violation below — red-first, ENGINE_STRUCTURE_PLAN §9):
  - areas derive under the work tree; ``ensure`` creates all three — the ``test_areas/ensure_…``.
  - ``resolve``/``resolve_root`` return in-tree paths for valid input — the two ``returns_…`` tests.
  - they reject unknown area, ``..`` escape, and absolute part — the ``rejects_…`` tests
    (pytest.raises: a non-raise is red); ``resolve_root()`` with no parts == root.
  - **the guard canonicalizes THROUGH symlinks** — an in-tree link pointing outside is rejected
    (``test_resolve…escape_through_an_in_tree_symlink``). The load-bearing red-proof: a lexical
    (``normpath``) refactor keeps every ``..`` test green yet lets this through, so this is the
    only test that pins ``.resolve()`` as the live-tree-unreachable mechanism.

# These are the load-bearing negative controls for the whole live-tree-unreachable guarantee.
# Every other escape test uses ".." strings, which *lexical* normalization collapses identically
# — so a refactor swapping resolve()'s symlink canonicalization for os.path.normpath would keep
# all of those green while opening a real escape. A symlink planted INSIDE the work tree but
# pointing OUTSIDE it is the input that distinguishes the two: only true canonicalization catches
# it. If either of these ever fails, the guard has stopped resolving symlinks — a real hole.
