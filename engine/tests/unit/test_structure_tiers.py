"""S0.3 — the structure axis's test-tier spine (ENGINE_STRUCTURE_TASKS).

Per the house tiers, expressed by naming + docstring, not markers (ENGINE_STRUCTURE_PLAN §9;
only ``golden``/``integration`` are registered markers, and ``golden`` is reserved for
live-parity targets — the net-new substrate has no live referent, so its synthetic artifact is a
**fixture**, never a golden). This file is the first inhabitant of four tiers the structure
done-whens lean on; S1+ join it with per-concern tier tests:

- **fixture / round-trip** — a generator-produced trivial artifact survives a write→read cycle
  through the real ``structure_map`` location accessor.
- **reference-integrity (binding)** — the fixture's declared ``schema_version`` resolves to the
  live ``STRUCTURE_MAP_SCHEMA_VERSION`` constant (``feedback_validate_bindings``).
- **property** — an invariant over synthetic book ids, not one fixture.
- **negative (fail-loud)** — the binding's failure branch raises, no skip-masking
  (``feedback_no_cheating_results``).

The fixture is produced by ``tests/fixtures/_generate_structure_fixture.py`` (dev-time, not
imported here — generators are run by hand to refresh, mirroring ``tests/golden``).

Each tier's binding is proven red on violation (red-first, §9): the committed↔generator match goes
red on any drift, content *or* bytes; the version binding raises on a bumped/missing constant
(positive + negative share one ``_assert_version_binds`` chokepoint, so neither can pass while the
other regresses); the property fails on a location collision; the location test fails if the bytes
don't survive the accessor. It deliberately does *not* assert a ``json.loads(json.dumps(x)) == x``
round-trip — that exercises stdlib, never structure code.
