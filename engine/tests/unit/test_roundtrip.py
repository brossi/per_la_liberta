"""S1.2 — the model-level raw round-trip floor (ENGINE_STRUCTURE_TASKS / PLAN §3.0/§9; D22).

The floor that makes an L1 atom's address *durable*: the raw witness text a ``raw_span`` +
``raw_source_hash`` point at must be recoverable byte-for-byte and provably unchanged, and a
normalized ``text`` may differ from that raw only by declared, reversible transforms. ``norm_layer``
is a label, never the guarantee — these tests pin exactly that.

Two tiers (§9), each proven red on violation (red-first, PLAN §9):
  - **(a) raw — byte-exact.** ``reconstruct_raw`` recovers ``source[start:end]`` byte-exact incl.
    multi-byte codepoints (``test_reconstruct_raw_*``); it raises on a hash mismatch (drifted
    source) or an out-of-bounds span — the negative cases a label cannot fake (D22). Red-inputs:
    drop the hash check → a wrong slice returns silently; drop the bounds check → an IndexError-free
    bad slice.
  - **(b) normalized — reversible.** ``apply_forward``/``apply_inverse`` compose transforms (inverse
    in *reverse* order — ``test_apply_inverse_reverses_order``, red-input: fold forward); a genuinely
    reversible transform round-trips and a *lossy* one does not (``test_is_reversible_*``); and
    ``verify_atom_roundtrip`` ties the tiers together — it recovers the raw, confirms the declared
    transforms produce the stored ``text``, and confirms their inverses recover the raw, failing
    loud otherwise (``test_verify_atom_roundtrip_*``).

The headline (``test_norm_layer_label_does_not_fake_the_floor``): an atom whose ``norm_layer`` claims
the text is verbatim, but whose stored ``text`` is not the raw, still fails — the floor checks bytes,
not the label. This is the model floor (in-memory ``source_text``); the real-input floor against the
committed PLL witnesses is S1.4.
