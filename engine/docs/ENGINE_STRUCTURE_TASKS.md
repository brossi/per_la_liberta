# Engine Structure — Task Decomposition & Development Tracker

Branch: `spike/document-structure`. Derives from the signed-off spec
**`ENGINE_STRUCTURE_PLAN.md`** (design ratified 2026-06-26, D1–D35) and its provenance
archive `ENGINE_STRUCTURE_PLAN_DISCUSSION.md`. This file turns that spec into trackable
development work; it does **not** re-decide anything — where it and the plan disagree, the
plan wins, and the discrepancy is a bug in this file.

This tracker is the **resolved** form of a multi-round adversarial audit (Codex × Claude,
2026-06-26). Every audit outcome is folded into the task tables, the Definition of Done, and
the milestone map below; the verbatim threads are archived in
**`ENGINE_STRUCTURE_TASKS_DISCUSSION.md`**, and the *§ Resolved-audit ledger* at the end maps
each resolution to where it landed.

## How to read / track this

- The spec answers *what & why*; this file answers *what to build, in what order, done
  when*. Every task cites the spec section and decision(s) it discharges (`§3.4`, `D33`),
  so a task that drifts from the spec is visible.
- **Status** is tracked per milestone in the two-axis rollup of the Milestone map
  (substrate vs PLL-instance — see *Definition of Done* for why the split is real) and in the
  `St` column of each task table. A milestone tier rolls up `DONE` when **all that tier's
  non-`DEFER` tasks are DONE**. Update the cell when a task moves; keep the rollup in sync.
- Audits use the house workflow: drop a `@@@@@@` block under **§ Audit log**, answer with a
  paired `======` (code-verified, per point); once resolved, fold the outcome into the
  affected task **and** the relevant spec section, strike the thread, and record the landing
  site in the *§ Resolved-audit ledger* before moving the verbatim thread to the discussion
  archive.
- Code anchors are `path · symbol` / `path:line` and were verified against the **engine
  tree** (`engine/src/engine/`) on the branch as of authoring; re-confirm before editing
  (line numbers drift). **Live-PLL evidence anchors** — cited as design evidence, not engine
  code to edit — are prefixed **`[live]`** and resolve in the *root* repo, not `engine/`.

## Conventions

**Task ids** — `S{milestone}.{task}` (e.g. `S4.2`). Milestones are `S0`–`S11`. Tasks added
after first authoring keep a stable id (e.g. `S2.0`, `S1.3a/b`, `S7.1b`) rather than
renumbering.

**Status legend** (`St`):

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `TODO` | not started |
| `WIP` | in progress |
| `DONE` | merged + tests green on branch |
| `DEFER` | deliberately not built now (carries a revisit condition) |
| `BLOCK` | blocked on an unmet dependency (names the blocker) |

**Scope tags** (from §6 / D31 — the build-enough discipline). *Distinct from `St`:* a tag is
what kind of work it is; `St` is how far along. A `SEAM` task is still built now.

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BUILD` | general mechanism **and** PLL-v2 instance, both now |
| `SEAM` | general mechanism now, **unpopulated** for PLL (a reserved hook) |
| `DEFER` | genuinely-unsolved; reserved hook only, no instance (overlap, D32) |
| `GATE` | an acceptance gate — downstream work is not "born" until it is green |
| `SCAF` | scaffolding / harness / probe, no shipped behavior |

**Test tiers** (house tiers, `uv run --directory engine pytest`; §9 of the spec):
`property` · `neutrality` · `golden` · `reference-integrity` · `round-trip` (raw byte-exact +
normalized reversible) · `re-binding` · `space-recon` · `scale` · `negative` (fail-loud, no
skip-masking).

> **`golden` is reserved for live-parity assertions only** (I3 anti-cheat: expected values
> come from the live implementation). It is therefore **applicable only where a live referent
> exists** — `S9.2a` chapterids golden, `S10.1` adapter, `S10.4` PLL golden. The net-new
> substrate (`S1`–`S7`) has **no live referent**, so its binding tiers are
> `property` / `round-trip` / `reference-integrity` / `negative`; a hand-authored synthetic
> artifact is a **`fixture`** or a `reference-integrity` test, **never** a "golden" (calling
> it golden would invite invented expected outputs wearing a parity badge —
> `feedback_no_cheating_results`). Each task's *Done-when* names its binding tier accordingly.

## Orientation — what the axis builds

Three concerns, non-linear (spec §2); a three-layer substrate (spec §3.2):

```
A. block extraction   → L1 immutable addressed atoms        (identity = atom_id)
B. structural assign.  → L2 versioned block projections       (identity = node_id)   ← runs first (D29)
C. relations           → L3 spans / fields / relations / align (typed endpoint union)
```

> **Runtime order vs build order — not a contradiction.** "B runs first (D29)" is a
> *pipeline-runtime* fact: **B runs before cleanup/triage and before any linguistic mutation
> — not before raw capture, and not before the L1 substrate exists.** The *build-time* DAG is
> the opposite direction — `S1` (A, the atom floor) precedes `S4` (B) because B projects over
> atoms. Read "B first" as "structure-before-text-mutation at runtime," never as "S4 before
> S1 at build time."

This substrate is in scope **because the engine is the production pipeline for a
re-translated PLL v2 (D28)** — a real build target, which is what makes the B/C governance
milestone (S8) necessary rather than speculative.

The **build / seam / defer** split this tracker implements, lifted from §6:

- **BUILD (PLL v2 instance):** ragged container tree (depth discovered); a **typed,
  correctable** block stream (A types via the book's block-classifier; **B can re-atomize /
  re-type, not merely re-group** — R3/D5); L2 `paragraph` + `verse` + the embedded-letter
  container; L1 geometry + Zipf-DP space reconstruction; opaque `node_id` + `rebind_anchors`
  + alias records; `position-path` + `ordinal-word` handle policies; block-level
  span-capable cross-language alignment; heterogeneous children; the three status axes +
  derived flags; lineage manifest + stale-fail governance; the second-structure fixture
  (D18); a scale check for the unbounded-unit-count design (D35).
- **SEAM (mechanism, no PLL instance):** depth-from-designation deriver (Tractatus);
  graph cross-ref edge type (Britannica dangling refs); per-node/per-span authorship
  beyond PLL's few overrides; block vocabulary beyond `paragraph`/`verse`; the degenerate
  `BlockClassifier` stub (S0.4) the S9 recognizer later replaces.
- **DEFER (genuinely unsolved):** overlapping / interleaved hierarchy — the reserved
  `participates-in` L3 hook only (D15/D32), no instance.

## Milestone map

Two-axis rollup (per *Definition of Done*): **Sub** = substrate / engine-agnostic mechanism;
**PLL** = the populated PLL-v2 instance (some of it legitimately `BLOCK` on v2-EN). `—` means
the milestone has no instance-tier work. The split keeps "substrate DONE / PLL-v2 input
BLOCKED" representable without a premature single green.

| # | Milestone | Concern | Gate(s) | St (Sub) | St (PLL) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S0 | Scaffolding & test spine | — | neutrality | `DONE` | — |
| S1 | L1 atom substrate | A | raw floor (S1.2) + **production round-trip (S1.4)** | `WIP` | `TODO` |
| S2 | Geometry capture (D30) | A | **bbox + text↔box probe (S2.0)** | `TODO` | `TODO` |
| S3 | Space / fragment reconstruction (D30) | A | corruption guard (S3.2) | `TODO` | `TODO` |
| S4 | L2 projections + `node_id` + structure map | B | **D18 schema-born fixture (S4.5)** | `TODO` | `TODO` (S4.6 map) |
| S5 | Re-binding (D33) | B | rebind fail-loud + regen-guard (S5.2) | `TODO` | — |
| S6 | Read-fields & status axes | B | — | `TODO` | — |
| S7 | L3 + relations + cross-language alignment | C | — | `TODO` | `BLOCK` (S7.2b on v2-EN) |
| S8 | Governance & lifecycle spine | B/C | negative battery (S8.3) | `TODO` | — |
| S9 | Recognition: profile + code escape | — | neutrality + **extractor-generality (S9.4)** | `TODO` | `TODO` |
| S10 | Integration & migration (F2/F3/F4) | — | PLL golden (S10.4) | `TODO` | `TODO` |
| S11 | Pre-translation smoke + post-build evaluation | — | none — diagnostic, **not** a gate | — | `TODO` |

## Dependency graph

```
S0 ──┬─ S0.4 BlockClassifier stub seam ──► S1.3b (nameable dep; real backend = S9)
     │
     └─ S1 ─┬─ S1.1 freezes the geom field SHAPE (Optional + match-provenance) ──► S4 schema
            │                                                          (S4 needs S1.1, NOT S2)

            │                                                  S1.5 atom-store schema + version
            │
            ├─ S2.0 bbox+alignment PROBE (GATE) ─► S2 geom ─┬─► S3 space-recon
            │        └ negative ─► S2.1-alt fallback         └─► S5 rebind ◄─ S4.5
            │        └ negative also ─► S5 mode = geometry-demoted / no-geometry
            │
            ├─ S3.0 resource + normalizer versioning ─► S3.1
            │
            └─ S4 schema ─► S4.5 D18 FIXTURE (schema born, GATE) ─► S5 · S6 · S7 · S8 · S10
                            S4.6 PLL map (human: Ben) · S4.7 scale test  ◄─ S4.1/S4.2
                            └─► S9.4 extractor-generality on the SAME S4.5 fixture (GATE)

 Gate rule:  no B/C task (S5–S8, S10) reaches DONE until S4.5 is green — so every such
             task lists S4.5 (not an S4 sub-task) as its upstream.
 Two D18 gates:  S4.5 = schema born (hand-authored JSON validates) ;
                 S9.4 = extractor generality (the SAME adversarial fixture travels
                        recognition → atoms → projections → adapter from raw).
 S8.1 (governance loader) is pulled EARLY — upstream of S5.2 (rebind fail-loud needs the
       regen-guard); S8.2/S8.3 stay downstream of S5/S7.
 S2.0 is pulled EARLY — a negative outcome reroutes S2 to S2.1-alt AND demotes geometry in
       S5 BEFORE S2/S3/S5 build on a bbox layer that may not exist or may not anchor the text.
 S9.2a (move-only relocation) MAY run parallel to S4 iff it is a literal move (zero new
       abstraction); the moment it needs an interim interface the L2 map reshapes, it becomes
       S9.2b and stays gated behind S4.5.
```

- **S4 is the keystone; S4.5 (D18) is its schema-birth gate.** S4's *schema* needs S1 (atoms)
  + the `geom` field shape, which **S1.1 freezes** — so S4 does **not** wait on S2's
  extraction backend. Geometry *extraction* (S2) and space reconstruction (S3) are a
  parallel pole feeding the PLL **instance** and re-binding (S5), not the schema.
- **The schema-born gate (S4.5) is not the generality proof.** S4.5 only validates
  hand-authored JSON; **S9.4** proves the recognizer reaches that same non-PLL structure from
  raw. Both are required before integration can claim D18 is operationally satisfied.
- **S5 needs both S2 and S4.5** (geometry is the primary re-bind signal where it exists; the
  map stores the anchors). A negative S2.0 does not block S5 — it selects S5's
  geometry-demoted / no-geometry operating mode (M2).

### Critical path

`S0 → S1 → S4 → S4.5 (D18 schema gate) → {S5 → S8.2/S8.3}` for the substrate; `S0 → S1 → S4 →
S10.4 (PLL golden)` for the integration payoff; `S4 → S4.5 → S9.4 (D18 generality gate)` for
the neutrality proof. The geometry pole `S2.0 → S2 → {S3, S5}` runs in parallel and rejoins
at S5. The long poles are **S4** (keystone + schema gate) and **S9** (relocating recognition
off the live cycle-breaker `chapter_identities` + the generality gate).

### Waves (what can run together)

- **W0:** S0 (incl. **S0.4** BlockClassifier stub)
- **W1:** S1 (S1.1 → S1.3a → S1.3b), **S2.0** (bbox+alignment probe — needs only the PLL
  PDF; gates S2), **S3.0** (resource/normalizer versioning), **S9.2a** (only if move-only)
- **W2:** S2 / S2.1-alt (after S2.0), **S1.4** (production round-trip), **S1.5** (atom-store
  schema), S4 schema (S4.1–S4.4, after S1)
- **W3:** S3, **S4.5 (D18 schema gate)**, S4.6 (human map), S4.7 (scale), **S8.1** (governance loader)
- **W4:** S5, S6, S7 (incl. S7.1b/S7.1c), **S9** (S9.1, S9.2b, **S9.4** generality gate) — all after S4.5 green
- **W5:** S8.2, S8.3, S10
- **W6:** **S11.0** (pre-translation smoke, before M4c consumes v2 Italian); S11.1/S11.2
  (academic, only once a full v2 extraction run exists — off the critical path)

## Tasks

### S0 — Scaffolding & test spine `SCAF`

Stand the package up before any behavior, with the neutrality guard live from commit one.

| ID | Deliverable | Refs | Deps | Done-when (tier) | Tag | St |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S0.1 | `engine/src/engine/structure/` package skeleton; schema-version constants; artifact locations fixed under `books/<id>/work/` (`atoms/`, `structure_map.json`, `relations.json`) | §3, §11 | — | package imports; constants asserted | `SCAF` | `DONE` |
| S0.2 | Neutrality guard `test_structure_neutrality`: core `structure/` carries no language/ordinal/structure literal (no `Capitolo`, no `«»`, no part-count) | §9, `feedback_engine_agnostic` | S0.1 | guard fails on a planted literal; green on the package | `GATE` | `DONE` |
| S0.3 | Test-tier harness stubs (property / fixture / reference-integrity / negative) wired into `uv run --directory engine pytest`; golden generator reuses the existing `engine/tests/golden/_generate_*_fixture.py` pattern (golden reserved for the live-parity tasks only — S9.2a/S10.1/S10.4) | §9 | S0.1 | tiers collect + run; a generator round-trips a trivial fixture | `SCAF` | `DONE` |
| S0.4 | **Minimal `BlockClassifier` Protocol seam + degenerate stub** (all-`unknown` classifier): the thin, nameable dependency S1.3b types against before the real S9 recognizer exists. Stub output is **incomplete-by-construction**, never a degenerate green (see S1.3b) | §2-A; D5/R3; §7.1 | S0.1 | seam injectable; the stub classifies every atom `unknown`; the real backend is S9 | `SEAM` | `DONE` |

### S1 — L1 atom substrate (concern A) `BUILD`

Immutable, addressed capture units — the floor everything pins to.

| ID | Deliverable | Refs | Deps | Done-when (tier) | Tag | St |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1.1 | L1 `Atom` model: `atom_id`, `witness`, `text`, `raw_span`, `raw_source_hash`, `page_range`, `norm_layer`, **`geom` slot — Optional, frozen here with match-provenance** (`{present\|absent}` + `{geometry_engine, matched_witness_id, match_method, match_confidence}`; **absence is a first-class state, never invented coordinates** — copy3 is geometry-free), `capture_provenance_class` (the L1 *capture* class — a **distinct** field from L2's content/editorial provenance, see S6.1/M4; final names are an impl choice, distinctness is the requirement), `derived_from`. Pure core dataclass, no language opinion | §3.0, §3.2, §11.1; D10, D20, D30 | S0 | property: ids unique, immutability holds; `geom` shape (incl. nullable + provenance) is **frozen** — S2/S4.4 depend on it | `BUILD` | `DONE` |
| S1.2 | **Model-level raw round-trip floor:** (a) raw byte-exact reconstruction from `raw_span` + `raw_source_hash` for a captured atom; (b) normalized = raw ⊕ declared reversible transforms. `norm_layer` is a label, never the guarantee. *This is the model floor; S1.4 is the real-input floor* | §3.0, §9; D22 | S1.1 | round-trip tier (a) byte-exact; (b) transform-reversible | `BUILD` | `DONE` |
| S1.3a | **Raw addressed capture** (no typing): re-segment `copy{1,2,3}_raw.txt` into per-witness atom streams **+** one canonical reconciled projection (`derived_from` back-links). `capture_provenance_class` + `processing_scope` carry furniture (captured-but-excluded ≠ never-captured). Re-built by re-running segmentation on the raw copies — **not** read-only from reconcile (see note) | §2-A, §3.0; multi-witness fact `reconcile.py:553–562 / :630–673 / :716 / :485`; D25 | S1.1 | property: every canonical atom has ≥1 witness derivation; furniture captured-with-role | `BUILD` | `DONE` |
| S1.3a.1 | **`build_canonical` fails loud on >2 structural witnesses** — it uses `witness_order[0:2]` and currently **silently ignores** `[2:]`; raise `CaptureError` ("N-way structural alignment unbuilt") so "exactly two structural witnesses" is a documented boundary, not a silent truncation (#16 audit, Thread 2) | §11.1; #16 | S1.3a | negative: ≥3 witnesses raises `CaptureError`; the 2-witness path unchanged | `BUILD` | `DONE` |
| S1.3a.2 | **Make `align_streams`'s `SequenceMatcher` junk policy explicit + owned** — pass `autojunk=True` rather than rely on the implicit default; comment that it is load-bearing (PLL canonical count swings 4786↔5226, ~9%, discarded keys are real OCR noise `3e`/`s:`/`35`) and mirrors `reconcile.align_paragraphs`. **Plus a source-layer guard** (AST, S0.2-guard family) that the `align_streams` `SequenceMatcher` call carries `autojunk` explicitly — a load-bearing default must be *owned, not inherited* (implicit reverts to difflib's default, a silent ~9% shift if that ever diverged across versions/interpreters) (#16 audit, Thread 3B) | `reconcile.py:188`; difflib `autojunk` default=`True` (3.13, verified); #16 | S1.3a | property + negative: junk policy explicit + documented; canonical count unchanged at the chosen setting; source guard reds on the implicit form (live mutation + planted-form discrimination) | `BUILD` | `DONE` |
| S1.3a.3 | **Oracle-back the five frozen real-input counts** (278/521/3621/3356/4786) — bind each to an **independent** re-derivation in-test (regex marker-count for furniture; `re.split` blank-block oracle for body/copy1/copy2, furniture-masked for copy3; difflib opcode→pair algebra for canonical — newly pinned `FROZEN_CANONICAL_ATOMS=4786`) so a segmenter regression **reds** instead of silently tracking a magic int. Frozen ints retained as **oracle-verified scale anchors** (`assert capture == oracle == frozen`), not the sole binding. Independence **graded honestly in-test**: only furniture is genuinely cross-architecture; body oracles are implementation-independent / spec-shared — judged adequate (a fully-independent body oracle must restate the same spec; the merge-not-caught-by-tiling gap is the real value-add) (#16 audit, Thread 3A) | §9; #16 | S1.3a | property: each count == its independent oracle == frozen anchor; **mutation-proven** (blank-flush drop → copy1 count binding reds at `1==3621` while `assert_capture_tiles` still passes — the count oracle catches a merge tiling alone misses) | `SCAF` (test) | `DONE` |
| S1.3a.4 | **Canonical-page tripwire** — pin that every canonical atom is `PAGE_UNMAPPED` today (canonical adopts copy1's unmapped address; copy3, the only page-bearing witness, is word-level → absent from the structural alignment), so S7.1b's page-attribution change is **loud + intentional**; this test is S7.1b's worklist marker (named `test_real_canonical_is_uniformly_page_unmapped_until_s7_1b`, greppable). **Non-vacuity control** in the model floor (`test_canonical_adopts_primary_page…`): a page-mapped primary yields a page-mapped canonical, so the real-input assertion is a genuine constraint, not `assert True` (#16 audit, Thread 1) | §11.1; D25; #16 | S1.3a | property: canonical stream is uniformly `PAGE_UNMAPPED`; assertion referenced by S7.1b; **red seen** (inject a page into copy1's capture → tripwire reds with the S7.1b-intent message) | `SCAF` (test) | `DONE` |
| S1.3a.5 | **Honest-prose fixes** — the "~46% both-derived" claim is a **structural (positional)** pairing stat, **not** content agreement (verified this session: 2191/4786 ≈ 46% `derived_from==2`, of which only 276 ≈ 6% are content-anchored `equal`; the rest are textually-divergent `replace` pairs → S7.1b). Corrected in the **#16 comment** (4817229857, one clause) + in-repo test prose (module docstring + canonical-test comment/message). The other three audit clarifications — `key=` as the per-book alignment lever, the exactly-two-structural-witness boundary, canonical page-attribution → S7.1b — verified **already stated** in `capture.py` docstrings + the #16 design comments (S1.3a.1/.4), not re-stated. **plan §11.1 carried no such claim** (grep-confirmed) — dropped as a target (#16 audit, Thread 3C/2/1) | #16 | S1.3a | both-derived claim corrected in the #16 comment + in-repo prose; other three confirmed present; plan §11.1 had no occurrence | `SCAF` (docs) | `DONE` |
| S1.3b | **Typed projection over the raw atoms** via the `BlockClassifier` (S0.4 stub → S9 real): each typed atom carries `typed_by` + `confidence` that **B may override** (re-type, R3/D5). **Profile-scoped completeness check:** unknowns in the profile's declared `boundary_classes` (heading / footnote-call / embedded-letter boundary — S9.1) **hard-fail**; unknowns in body leaves **route to review** with count + location (reuses the S6 truth-table machinery). An **all-`unknown` projection FAILS** completeness — `unknown` is a first-class *incomplete* state, never a degenerate green. **Built** (`structure/typed.py`): `TypedAtom` (Atom+`BlockClassification` pair — typing is a re-runnable projection B re-types, not a mutation), `typed_projection(atoms, classifier)` (positional zip; fail-loud on a seam-contract count mismatch, no silent tail-drop), `check_completeness(typed, *, boundary_classes) -> CompletenessReport`. **Discriminator decision:** the boundary-vs-body axis is the L1 `capture_provenance_class` matched against the profile-supplied `boundary_classes` — it *must* be independent of the typed `block_class` (an atom can't be both `block_class∈boundary` and `==UNKNOWN`), so the hard-fail keys on (capture-class∈boundary ∧ block_class==UNKNOWN). Degenerate (all-`unknown`) checked **first** (distinct root cause — resolved-nothing) → raises `IncompleteTypingError` (errors.py, exit 9); boundary-class unknown → raises (names atom+span); body-leaf unknown → non-raising `CompletenessReport.to_review` (count+location). Empty projection = vacuously complete (capture-emptiness is S1.3a/S1.4's concern). **S6 reuse is forward** — S6 unbuilt, so `CompletenessReport` is the minimal local shape S6's policy truth-table will subsume, *not* a wire-in. **Adversarial pass (independent reviewer) → two fixes:** (i) the check now scopes to **processed** (`processing_scope`-included) atoms — excluded furniture left `unknown` is exempt (§3.0 captured-but-excluded), never mis-routed to body-review nor hard-failed; `processed_count` (was `typed_count`) counts only in-scope atoms; (ii) the boundary hard-fail is honestly a **mechanism + forward contract, not a real-input guarantee** — today's capture tags every non-furniture line `authorial` and forces named `classify_line` results to `excluded`, so a real boundary left `unknown` routes to **review** (flagged, never silent) until S9 makes capture granular (relaxing the capture.py non-body→excluded coupling). Real-path tests added (`capture_witness → typed_projection → check_completeness`). **5-lens adversarial pass (spec / correctness / test-quality / neutrality / architecture, overlapping coverage) → further fixes:** reject a bare-`str` `boundary_classes` (char-set severity-inversion); switch the scope filter to `!= excluded` (an out-of-vocab `processing_scope` stays in scope, closing a reopened degenerate-green); bind too-many-classifications, ≥2 review-items (count>1), ≥2 boundary offenders, and a real-capture route-to-review; correct the overstated "no design could identify a boundary" premise (a heading recognizer exists; the branch is dead by capture-scope *choice*) + log the considered-rejected "defer regime to S9.1"; flag that `to_review`'s consumer is the governance surface, not S6's truth-table. Cross-file items (body_class neutrality, Atom scope-validation, typed_by enforcement, wholesale-exclusion seam) logged for decision. 36 tests, **15 invariants mutation-proven** red | §2-A; D5/R3 | S1.3a, **S0.4** | property: boundary-class unknown raises; body-leaf unknown routes-to-review with count+location; all-`unknown` fails completeness | `BUILD` | `DONE` |
| S1.4 | **Production-stream round-trip GATE (real-input floor):** reconstruct each of `copy{1,2,3}_raw` byte-for-byte **through the atom-store's public read path consumers use** (witness iteration, filter-by-witness, canonical-projection load — exercise the shapes S10.2's consumers call; never a private helper, never re-reading raw source). Assert the **capture-completeness invariant** (every source byte is inside an atom's `raw_span` or recorded as declared inter-atom/furniture) **and span topology** (ordered, non-overlapping coverage with explicit gap records). **Core landed** (`structure/roundtrip_gate.py`, #21): `GapRecord` (explicit declared gap), `gap_records` (the tiling/topology walk — `assert_capture_tiles` now **delegates** here, single owner), `reconstruct_source` (whole-artifact byte-exact from stored atom+gap text — the gate's `==source` compare catches an `atom.text` drifted off its span, a drift the per-atom hash re-slices past), `assert_no_wholesale_exclusion` (owns the S1.3b-deferred "excluded everything" seam), `assert_production_roundtrip` (the gate entry). Runs over real `copy{1,2,3}_raw` (whole-artifact reconstruct + overlap/implicit-gap/text-drift/all-excluded negatives). **5-lens overlapping adversarial audit** (spec/correctness/test-quality/neutrality/architecture) → no blockers, all mutants killed (2 survivors proven *equivalent*); hardening applied: `GapRecord` whitespace-only enforced at construction (durable record fails loud on content), `reconstruct_source` rejects an out-of-order atom stream (no silent re-sort), canonical-stream out-of-whole-artifact-scope tripwire + the persist-gaps decision recorded for S1.5 (carried note), 0.5-floor over-claim softened. 32 tests, 14 mutants killed. **S1.5-gated closure (row stays `WIP`):** route the reconstruction through the atom-store public read path + add the **back-door-read** negative — needs S1.5 | §3.0, §9; D22 | S1.3a | round-trip + negative tiers: byte-exact via the public read path; overlap/implicit-gap/back-door read each fail loud | `GATE` | `WIP` |
| S1.5 | **Atom-store persisted schema + independent version** (per-witness + canonical streams), its own lineage entry + **its own S8.1 stale class** (M3); store round-trip asserts **serialization-invariance** of `raw_span` / `raw_source_hash` / `geom` / `derived_from` (not just text); reference-integrity (every `derived_from` back-link resolves) | §3.5, §3.6, §11.1; D21 | S1.3a | reference-integrity + round-trip tiers: schema validates, version registered, serialization-invariant, back-links resolve | `BUILD` | `TODO` |

> **Why now:** for PLL, copy3 *always* has a page map, so *every* copy1/copy2/canonical atom is

> **Carried review concerns (issue #16 audit) — revisit later, opened-not-closed by the burnish.**
> Three threads S1.3a.1–.3 *surface* but do not *settle*:
> - **N-way structural alignment.** S1.3a.1 makes >2 structural witnesses **fail loud**; it does
>   not build genuine N-way (multiple-sequence) structural alignment. No current book needs >2
>   structural witnesses (PLL's copy3 is word-level), so the capability stays deferred — **revisit

>   not the *limitation*.
> - **`autojunk=True` is explicit + source-guarded, but the policy is not *validated*.** S1.3a.2
>   ends the reliance on the *silent default* — and an AST guard keeps the call explicit — but it
>   does not prove `True` is the right policy. The junk heuristic discards high-frequency keys —

>   count looks degraded. (The ownership *guard* is scoped to this one call; extend the pattern if
>   another load-bearing stdlib default enters `structure/`.)
> - **Characterize "both-derived" as a vector, not a scalar.** Today the canonical projection is

> - **The boundary hard-fail is dead on *real* input today — by a capture-scope CHOICE, not an

>   identify a boundary under *any* design") was **wrong**: a heading recognizer already exists in the
>   live tree (`lang/italian.py:211 is_chapter_heading`, a ported regex), and `classify_line` is an

>   boundary capture-class can exist yet. Relaxing that coupling + injecting a heading-aware
>   `classify_line` would make the branch fire on real PLL input **without** the S9 recognizer. S1.3b
>   **deliberately keeps capture coarse** (that relaxation is S9.1/capture scope), so the branch stays
>   synthetic-tested — a scope decision, not a law of physics. **Considered-and-rejected alternative:**
>   *defer the whole boundary regime to S9.1* (ship only the degenerate + body-leaf regimes, which DO
>   fire on real input). Rejected because the mechanism is cheap, de-risks S9, and the degenerate
>   regime reuses the same machinery; **but** the public surface (`boundary_classes` param + the
>   boundary `raise` + S9.1's profile-schema contract) is thereby committed to a discriminator the
>   revisit note above marks provisional — a conscious seam-vs-defer trade, logged here so it is not
>   read as inevitability. Do not re-inflate the synthetic branch to a working real-input guarantee.
> - **A profile declaring a real block class literally named `"unknown"` would alias the
>   sentinel** (`classify.UNKNOWN`), making resolved atoms read as incomplete. Unguardable in
>   `check_completeness` (it never sees the profile's full block-class vocabulary). **Defer to S9.1
>   profile-load validation** — reject a profile whose declared classes collide with `UNKNOWN` — and
>   keep `UNKNOWN` reserved (already asserted in prose, `classify.py` ~14–15).
> - **`to_review`'s forward consumer is the governance surface, NOT S6's truth-table (audit
>   correction).** The done-when says "reuses the S6 truth-table machinery", but S6.2 computes
>   behavioral *flags* for *resolved L2 nodes* from L2 provenance, whereas `to_review` queues
>   *unresolved L1 atoms* keyed on L1 `capture_provenance_class` — a different layer/axis/lifecycle.
>   The likelier home is the **S8.1-style HITL stale/repair report** (where re-bind failures already

>   than asserting S6 subsumption. **The done-when wording is a spec tension to resolve at S6/S8.1**,
>   not just prose — flagged, not silently rewritten.
>
> **Cross-file items from the 5-lens audit — THREE APPLIED this pass (authorized), two remain:**
> - **APPLIED — Neutrality: `capture.py`'s `body_class` default `"authorial"` → `"body"` (S1.3a).**
>   "Authorial" is a *content/editorial* word ("who authored it") that was baked as the default in a
>   *capture-provenance* field (`atoms.py` defines that field as distinct from L2 content provenance);
>   S0.2's literal scan misses it, and it was asymmetric with `boundary_classes` (required, no default).
>   Renamed to the slot-neutral `"body"`. (Ripple: `test_raw_capture` default assertion + the S1.3b
>   real-capture test updated; hand-built fixtures keep an arbitrary class, proving the field is free.)
> - **APPLIED — Robustness: `Atom.__post_init__` now validates `processing_scope ∈ {included,
>   excluded}` (S1.1).** The free-`str` field was the root cause behind the whitelist hole; the closed
>   vocabulary at the model fixes the class, not the instance — a typo'd scope now fails at
>   construction, so it can never reach `check_completeness` and vanish. (The S1.3b `!= excluded` filter
>   stays as defense-in-depth + the semantic scoping.)
> - **APPLIED — Stated-but-unenforced: `BlockClassification.__post_init__` now rejects an empty
>   `typed_by` (S0.4).** The "never an anonymous label" guarantee is enforced, not just prose — B's
>   override attribution (R3/D5) can no longer be blank.
> - **APPLIED (S1.4, #21) — Unowned seam: "wholesale-wrong-exclusion."** A capture that mis-tags all

>   (vacuously complete, `processed_count=0`). `roundtrip_gate.assert_no_wholesale_exclusion` now owns

Sample **stratified across** front matter, dense prose, page furniture, chapter starts, footnotes, bad-OCR regions, and the embedded-letter area (≥10 pages is a floor, not the spec).

### S4 — L2 projections + `node_id` + structure map (concern B) — **keystone**

The durable catalogue. **S4.5 (D18) is the schema-birth gate for the whole B/C substrate;
S9.4 is its end-to-end generality twin.**

| ID | Deliverable | Refs | Deps | Done-when (tier) | Tag | St |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S4.1 | L2 projection model: container vs leaf; open per-book block vocabulary (PLL: `paragraph`, `verse`, embedded-letter container); **no-double-ownership** invariant; **B can re-atomize and re-type, not merely re-group** (the block-classifier output is correctable, R3/D5) | §3.1, §3.2, §11.2; D10, **D5/R3** | S1.1 | property: no atom owned twice; ragged depth 0–4 + recursion + **heterogeneous sibling classes** representable; a mis-typed atom is corrected by B (re-type) | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S4.2 | `node_id` identity + minting split: opaque, persisted, **never recomputed** from position/designation/content; humans mint containers, extractor machine-mints leaves (counter/ULID); `minted_by` field | §3.4; D11, D20, D33 | S4.1 | property: id stable across re-serialize **and after a positional move** (re-mint proves position-independence) | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S4.3 | Handle policy + rendered handles + alias records: per-node-class `handle_policy` (`position-path` \| `designation-string` \| `title` \| …) with inheritance; `(node_id, handle_policy)` renders `short`/`parse_md`/`html_slug`; alias record `{handle_type,value,scope,locale_or_witness,target_node_id,valid_from,valid_to,status}` | §3.4, §3.6; D12, D24, D33 | S4.2 | property: handle change leaves `node_id` fixed, old handle survives as alias | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S4.4 | `structure_map.json` **schema** + **lineage manifest** header. Manifest carries, **each independently versioned with its own stale class** (M3): raw witness hashes; the **atom-store** schema version (S1.5); the **relation-store** schema version (S7.1c); `canonical_stream_id` + canonical-projection hash; the **resource + normalizer** versions (S3.0); profile + recognizer versions. `geom` shape consumed from S1.1's frozen slot (incl. match-provenance) | §3.5, §3.6, §11.2; D21 | S4.1–S4.3, **S1.1 (geom shape)** | schema validates; reference-integrity tier (every ref resolves); manifest lists all three persisted-layer schema versions; schema's `schema_version` `const` **equals** `STRUCTURE_MAP_SCHEMA_VERSION` — bound by validating the version-derived fixture (`_generate_structure_fixture.py`) against the schema, **not** a hand-copied literal (the `manifest.schema.json` precedent hard-codes the const with no Python constant behind it — do not repeat it) | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S4.5 | **D18 GATE (schema born) — second-structure synthetic fixture built to DIFFER from PLL:** depth-0 body (no parts), `designation-string` handle policy, **non-ordinal headings**, **mismatched body segmentation**, alias-uniqueness-in-scope, stale-manifest failure, relation-endpoint resolution. **This is the SAME adversarial fixture S9.4 drives end-to-end** (reuse, not a new one). **Distinct from `books/synthetic`** (prefazione + 1 part, Italian ordinals, H2/H3 — a miniature PLL, *not* a differ-fixture) | §6, §9; D18; `feedback_single_fixture_blind_spots` | S4.1–S4.4 | the hand-authored fixture validates; **schema is not "born" until it does**. (Generality is proven separately at S9.4) | `GATE` | `TODO` |
| S4.6 | **Hand-author the PLL container map** (~61 containers). **Owner: Ben (human-in-the-loop).** Workflow specified: which file is edited; the known PLL skeleton (prefazione + 2 parts + 57 chapters + the embedded letter) **seeds candidates**; the **embedded-letter placement is verified at authoring** (pin the Mazzini-letter's chapter); review comments captured; minimum evidence beyond the skeleton recorded. S9 later makes the map *recognizer-suggested* — that comparison is **advisory** (gate = every recognizer disagreement surfaced + reviewed + accepted-or-explicitly-overridden, **human ruling authoritative** per S8.2), never "recognizer must match the hand map" | §3.5; D28/D29 (HITL premise) | S4.4 | the authored map validates against PLL's known skeleton; embedded-letter chapter pinned; review trail captured | `BUILD` (human) | `TODO` |
| S4.7 | **Scale check (D35).** Named ops under test — tree traversal, reference-integrity resolution, re-bind lookup — stay **sub-quadratic** across sizes (10⁴ → 10⁵ leaf nodes); budget is a rough **wall-clock + peak-memory ceiling that includes serialize + load + index-build** (a CLI pays the load cost every invocation), **machine ops only** (the human container-authoring ceiling is **O3**, not this gate). CI: a small always-on shape check; the full 10⁵ tier nightly/opt-in. Shares one benchmark fixture with the S1.4/S1.5 store round-trip | §3.5; **D35** | S4.1, S4.2 | scale tier: growth ratio sub-quadratic incl. load/index time; flat addressable storage holds at 10⁵ within budget | `BUILD` | `TODO` |

> **S4.4 + S4.6 bootstrap order:** the hand-authored PLL map (S4.6) gives S5–S8 something
> real to chew on; S9 later makes that map *recognizer-suggested* (advisory). The existing
> `books/synthetic` is a pipeline fixture (copy1/2/3 → reconciled), **not** a structure-differ
> fixture — S4.5 builds a new one (depth-0 / designation-string, Kybalion- or
> Tractatus-shaped), reused by S9.4.
> **Design ceiling for S4.7:** PLL ≈ 10³ leaf nodes; Pepys ≈ 10⁴; a full reference-work volume
> (Britannica-class) ≈ 10⁵ — two orders above PLL. The test asserts sub-quadratic *shape*, so
> the number can move without reworking the task.

| S5.1 | `rebind_anchors` per node: **geometry region** (primary where matched, from D30 word-boxes), **fuzzy/fail-loud content fingerprint** (never the exact-substring the live tree tombstoned), **structural-path** tie-break. **Three explicit operating modes — `geometry-primary` \| `geometry-tie-break` \| `no-geometry` — selected by S2.0's outcome and recorded in the structure-map lineage / rebind config** (M2), so a re-bind result is interpretable after the fact. Re-attach algorithm with an **explicit confidence threshold** defaulting toward **fail-loud on doubt**: unique + above-threshold → bind; else fail loud | §3.4, §3.6; D33, R2; `feedback_existing_path_failures_as_evidence` | S2, **S4.5** | re-binding tier: regenerated stream re-binds stored ids under unchanged geometry; the active mode is recorded in lineage | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S5.2 | Re-binding negatives + **threshold calibration on a labeled truth set** + **regen-guard registration**. Calibration: a perturbation model (OCR-class char subs, re-segmentation, whitespace shifts, local reorder) over a stream with a **recorded identity map** (ground truth known by construction); report **false-bind / fail-loud / missed-bind separately**, treating **false-bind (silent-wrong) as the dominant cost → asymmetric threshold**; a **real re-extraction delta** sample is added *when available* (non-blocking). **Monotone-strictness property:** lowering signal strength (geometry-primary → tie-break → no-geometry) must **never lower the threshold or raise auto-bind coverage** — the correct response to "too many fail loud in no-geometry" is more human review, not a lower bar (`feedback_no_cheating_results`). Structure map joins the regeneration-guard family (one-way gate) | §3.4, §9; D33 | S5.1, **S8.1** | negative tier raises; the three rate classes measured; monotone-strictness property holds; regen-guard refuses silent regen of the map | `GATE` | `TODO` |

### S6 — Read-fields & status axes, §3.3 (concern B) `BUILD`

| ID | Deliverable | Refs | Deps | Done-when (tier) | Tag | St |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S6.1 | Three **orthogonal** axes: `role` (`front\|body\|back`, structural matter only); `authorship` (scope `work\|witness\|translation\|span`, overridable — PLL's Mazzini-letter override); **`content_provenance_class` / editorial-status at L2** (`authorial\|editorial\|translator-note\|transcriber\|generated-TOC\|scan-OCR-furniture\|source-wrapper\|renderer-added`). **Distinct name from L1's `capture_provenance_class` (S1.1) — no shared identifier across layers** (M4: enforcement-by-construction, so no consumer can grab the convenient field and bypass the rollup). Designation ≠ title (both optional display fields) | §3.3; D13, D23 | **S4.5** | property: axes independent; no `excluded` smuggled into `role`; L1 and L2 provenance fields are distinctly named | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S6.2 | Derived behavioral flags `translatable` / `alignable` / `counts_for_retention` / `rendered`, computed by policy from the axes; validators switch on **flags**, not on a raw provenance-class literal (either layer). **Layer-ownership pinned: a node's flags read L2 fields + a declared L1 rollup; a node mixing authorial-body and furniture atoms must EITHER split the projection (preferred — respects no-double-ownership) OR carry an explicit, tested mixed-rollup** (silent mixed rollup is the failure mode). A **policy truth-table fixture** asserts the four flags for each real PLL `content_provenance_class` + ≥1 second-fixture class, covering the dangerous rows: furniture (captured-not-rendered), source-wrapper (captured-not-translated), footnote-body retention, translator-note alignability, embedded-letter authorship | §3.3; D23 | S6.1 | property: adding a `provenance_class` needs no validator edit; the truth-table fixture pins every flag (incl. the dangerous rows) and which layer it reads from | `BUILD` | `TODO` |

### S7 — L3 + relations + cross-language alignment, R5/D34 (concern C)

| ID | Deliverable | Refs | Deps | Done-when (tier) | Tag | St |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S7.1 | `SpanRef = {atom_id,start,end}` + typed endpoint union (`atom_range \| projection_node \| span_ref`); L3 span/field model (speaker/date/author/citation; footnote = L2 note-body + L3 call-site span + `note-of` relation). **Reference-integrity is multi-namespace** (M3): every endpoint resolves across `atom_id`, `node_id`, cross-language target node ids, and aliases | §3.2, §11.3; D19 | S1.1, **S4.5** | reference-integrity: every endpoint resolves in **every** namespace it can address | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S7.1b | **Legacy flag → `SpanRef` migration + steady-state disagreement artifact.** One-time: convert `[live] data/flagged_segments.json` `(ch_id, para_idx)` word flags → `SpanRef` endpoints over canonical atoms, **preserve per-witness evidence**, **fail-loud if a flag cannot re-bind** (the operational half of F4's "disagreements become L3 spans"). Durable: define the steady-state artifact so the re-architected reconcile (S10.2) **emits disagreement spans natively** — the conversion only seeds it; **no old `(ch_id,para_idx)` surface under a new name**; the copy3↔canonical word-level linkage this establishes is also the prerequisite for **canonical page-attribution** (see the S1.3a `PAGE_PENDING` deferral note) | §2-A, §3.2, F4; D19, D25 | S7.1, **S4.5** | every legacy flag re-binds to a SpanRef or fails loud; per-witness evidence preserved; the native-emission artifact is specified | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S7.1c | **Relation-store persisted schema + independent version** + **its own S8.1 stale class** (M3 relations half). `relations.json` validates against the schema; the schema version is a distinct lineage entry, not folded under `structure_map.json` | §3.5, §3.6, §11.3; D21 | S7.1 | reference-integrity + round-trip tiers: schema validates, version registered independently | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S7.2a | **Cross-language alignment MECHANISM** (general source↔target, LANG_A↔LANG_B, **not** bespoke IT↔EN): many-to-many over `node_id`/`SpanRef`, per-edge `method` (`by-index\|by-content\|human`) + `confidence`, versioned `alignment_set`; a paragraph index is *one method*, never the durable key. **Synthetic two-language fixture carries unequal (M:N) segmentation + a partial-span edge** — a 1:1 fixture would not exercise the failure that created the live `typeset.py` mispoint. **A thin harness consumer pairs source↔target via the relation (not the index)**, proving the durable key is consumable | §4 R5; D7, D34; `[live]` `typeset.py:609` mispoint evidence | **S4.5**, S7.1 | property: index-as-method, node-id-as-key; the M:N + partial-span fixture aligns; the harness consumes the relation, not a paragraph index | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S7.2b | **PLL IT↔EN alignment INSTANCE** — the populated source↔target set for PLL. **BLOCK on v2-EN** (the EN side does not exist as projection nodes while M4c is paused). The v1-`english_translation.md` demo is **YAGNI** — built only if a specific need appears, and then only in a **throwaway namespace** with a lineage marker barring any cache/citation from treating it as production; never the durable v2 set | §4 R5; D7, D34 | S7.2a, v2-EN translation | a populated IT↔EN `alignment_set` over real v2 nodes (or, if ever built, an explicitly-throwaway v1 demo) | `BUILD` | `BLOCK` (v2-EN) |
| S7.3a | **Graph cross-ref edge type** (may dangle / resolve externally — Britannica): concern-C edge orthogonal to containment, with external/unresolved semantics. Mechanism now, no PLL instance | §6; D14 (C edges); R1 (EB) | S7.1 | property: an edge may dangle and is reported, not silently dropped | `SEAM` | `TODO` |
| S7.3b | **Reserved `participates-in` hook** (`contiguous:false`, typed members) for overlapping / interleaved hierarchy. Reserved only — no instance, Hamlet-conformance-checked | §6; D15, D32; R4 | S7.1 | the hook exists + is uninstantiated; Hamlet case documented as the trigger | `DEFER` | `DEFER` |

> S7.2a/b are the structural replacement for the shipped `[live] typeset.py:609` mispoint (EN
> paragraph *index* reused on the IT column; 23/58 chapters diverge → 14 mispoints). The
> mispoint exists **because** IT/EN paragraph counts diverge — which is exactly why the
> mechanism's key is `node_id`/`SpanRef` over M:N edges, and why the S7.2a fixture must carry
> M:N + a partial-span edge. Cited as evidence only — fixing the live `typeset.py` is a
> separate live-PLL matter (deploy-hold, not this branch). **Forward dependency:** the engine
> **typeset port (M3b)** must consume S7.2 alignment (not a paragraph index) — see *Cross-track
> relationships*. This axis ships the mechanism + harness + the named obligation on M3b; it
> does not ship the renderer.

### S8 — Governance & lifecycle spine, §3.6 (concern B/C) `BUILD`

S8.1 (the loader) is pulled into W3 — it is a prerequisite of S5.2's fail-loud, not a
follow-on. S8.2/S8.3 stay downstream of the models they police.

| ID | Deliverable | Refs | Deps | Done-when (tier) | Tag | St |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S8.1 | Stale = **fail-loud** loader keyed on the lineage manifest; *why-stale → which-migration* routing. **Emits a typed stale report** (what changed · which class · what to run next) + a per-class **manual repair runbook**, each entry **asserted by a test, not just written**: changed raw hash → re-capture; changed normalizer → re-derive offsets; changed projection → re-attach L2/L3; changed dict/oracle → re-segment; **changed atom-store schema (S1.5) / changed relation-store schema (S7.1c) → migrate** — each produces a **distinct diagnostic + next command**. **Recovery defaults to dry-run/report;** any rewrite of map/atom/relation artifacts requires an explicit output target, a **snapshot-before-migrate** (mirroring `refine.py`), and a **new lineage entry** — the migration path itself **joins the regen-guard family** (unsafe recovery is worse than a block, Principle 4) | §3.6; D14, D21 | S4.4, S1.5, S7.1c | negative: each stale class fails load until refresh/migrate **and** emits its own asserted diagnostic; recovery is dry-run-by-default + snapshot-guarded | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S8.2 | Decision provenance per entry (`human-approved\|plugin-suggested\|inherited`; re-suggestion never overwrites a human ruling); **C-corrections are reviewer-approved patches** to L2/L3, never auto-rewrite of L1; L1 supersession-by-new-stream + tombstone (kept-marked-invalid) | §3.6; D14, D25 | S4.4, S5.1 | property: human ruling survives re-suggest; superseded atom ids stay addressable | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S8.3 | **Negative battery** (fail-loud, no skip-masking): alias collision in scope · unresolved relation endpoint (multi-namespace) · stale lineage manifest (each class) · ambiguous re-bind — each asserts the raise. Plus reference-integrity binding (every ref / endpoint / `status:active` alias resolves to exactly one node) | §9; `feedback_validate_bindings`, `feedback_no_cheating_results` | S4.5, S5, S7 | negative + reference-integrity tiers green; no `skipif` masking | `GATE` | `TODO` |

### S9 — Recognition: profile + code escape, §7.1 (D17/D27) — resolves BR-021

| ID | Deliverable | Refs | Deps | Done-when (tier) | Tag | St |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S9.1 | Structure profile (`engine/profiles/structure/` + new `BookManifest.profile_refs["structure"]`): **data primitives only** — heading regexes, running heads, matter labels, designation grammar, numbering scope, block-split rules, **and the `boundary_classes` set** (heading / footnote-call / embedded-letter boundary) that S1.3b's completeness check hard-fails on — declared as ***capture-provenance-class* values** (the axis S1.3b matches; see the S1.3b note) **and granular capture must emit them as *included* classes** (relax the `capture.py` non-body→`excluded` coupling). **Must reject a profile whose declared classes collide with `UNKNOWN`** (`classify.UNKNOWN`) — the sentinel-alias footgun S1.3b cannot guard (no block-class vocabulary in scope there). No DSL, no control flow in JSON. **Mirror the existing `engine/profiles/{languages,source_noise,typefaces}` schema convention** | §7.1; D17, D27; `config/models.py · BookManifest:108` (`profile_refs:113`) | S4.5 | profile loads via the existing loader pattern; `boundary_classes` is consumable by S1.3b; a class colliding with `UNKNOWN` is rejected; neutrality tier still green | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S9.2a | **Mechanical relocation (move-only).** Relocate the abstract structure surface — `is_chapter_heading` / `parse_chapter_number` / `structural_part` / `strip_boilerplate` / `split_raw_chapters` (`lang/base.py:42–78`) **and the ordinal/heading data tables** (`lang/italian.py:26–290`) — out of `LanguagePlugin` into the structure recognizer, **preserving the chapterids golden, with ZERO new abstraction**. MAY run parallel to S4 **iff** it stays a literal move; the moment it needs an interim interface the L2 map will reshape, it is no longer move-only → becomes S9.2b (gated). The cycle-breaker `chapter_identities:107` (produces all three id namespaces together) is the delicate part — move without disturbing it | §7.1, F1; D8, D17, D27 | S9.1 *(or parallel to S4 if move-only)* | the abstract structure surface is **gone from `lang/base.py`** (asserted); `engine/tests/golden/test_chapterids_golden.py` reproduces PLL identities **unchanged**; **no new abstraction introduced** | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S9.2b | **Map-binding recognizer output + identity proof.** Bind the relocated recognizer's output to the L2 map; narrow **code-escape** reader for irreducibly procedural cases (Hamlet turn-state). **Store-and-rebind assertion** (beyond the golden): mutate a designation and show `node_id` is **fixed** while the rendered handle changes and the **old handle survives as an alias** (S4.3's property on the relocated recognizer — this is the BR-021 win, not mere adapter compatibility). **Alias-collision clause:** if the retired handle now collides in scope, the system **fails or demands a resolved alias state** — never silently maps one handle to two nodes (the S8.3 collision negative, exercised here) | §7.1, F1; D8, D11, D33 | S9.2a, **S4.5** | designation-mutation: `node_id` fixed, handle re-renders, old handle aliased; collision → fail/resolved-alias | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S9.3 | **Depth-from-designation deriver seam** (Tractatus dotted-decimal → depth 0–6). Mechanism now, **unpopulated for PLL** (PLL uses `position-path`, no depth derivation) | §6; R1 (Tractatus) | S9.1, S4.3 | Tractatus-style designation computes depth via the seam; PLL path does not invoke it | `SEAM` | `TODO` |
| S9.4 | **D18 GATE (extractor generality, end-to-end).** The **SAME adversarial differ-fixture S4.5 births the schema on** travels **recognition → atoms → projections → adapter from raw** (not hand-authored JSON) under an **Italian-free core**. Because the fixture has no parts and non-ordinal/designation-string handles, a "translated-PLL with relabeled headings" parser cannot pass it. This is the operational proof of D18 that S4.5 alone does not give | §7.1, §9; D18; `feedback_single_fixture_blind_spots` | S9.1, S9.2b, S4.5 | the non-PLL fixture is recognized end-to-end by an Italian-free core; integration may claim D18 operationally satisfied | `GATE` | `TODO` |

> **Highest-regression seam.** `lang/base.py · chapter_identities:107` is the live cycle-breaker
> that produces all three id namespaces together; moving recognition without disturbing it
> is the delicate part (S9.2a). **Resolves BR-021** (position-based chapter identity) and
> **supersedes BR-019 / BR-020** (stable id, single ordinal model) — close those in

### S10 — Integration & migration, §7.2–7.4 (F2/F3/F4) `BUILD`

| ID | Deliverable | Refs | Deps | Done-when (tier) | Tag | St |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S10.1 | **F4** read-only adapter: L2 blocks → legacy `{id,title,part,text}` (`text = "\n\n".join(paragraph projections)`) behind reconcile; B runs **structure-first** (D29). Read-only — never a write-back path; it is also the **rollback surface** (a regressing consumer reverts to the adapter). **Explicit block→legacy-text compatibility policy — a total function over registered block classes → {flatten \| omit-with-reason \| reject}, with the default for an UNREGISTERED/unknown class = `reject` (fail-loud), never permissive flatten** (the silent-loss trap the adapter exists to bridge around); a test asserts the policy | §7.4; D16, D26, D29; O5 | S4.5 | existing consumers pass unchanged against the adapter; the compatibility policy is total + tested; unknown class → reject | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S10.2 | Consumer migration, **triage first** (in-place rewriter `triage.py:286–327` → edits become governed L2/L3 patches), then `cleanup.py:915/935` (the `ch["text"]` reads; `:882` is the input-load), then `validate.py:432–465` — one BR at a time; **a regressing consumer reverts to the S10.1 adapter**; the adapter is retired only when **all** consumers are green off it | §7.4; D26 | S10.1, S8.2 | each migrated consumer drops the adapter, reads blocks; suite stays green | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S10.3 | **F2** replace `Structure` validator (`config/models.py · Structure:62`, the `h2_min`/`h3_count`/`parts` shape) with the general tree/blocks model + per-book structure map; `validate`'s count checks become assertions over the map, switching on S6 derived flags | §7.2, F2 | S4.5, S6 | validate asserts over the map; the S4.5 depth-0 fixture validates | `BUILD` | `TODO` |
| S10.4 | **F3** rework `ChapterIdentity` (`util/chapterids.py · ChapterIdentity:24`) → opaque `node_id` + rendered handles + aliases. **PLL golden pins the RENDERED layer by exact match** — legacy `short`, `parse_md` key, `html_slug`, provenance-key, revision-key, **and alias resolution for a retired handle** all reproduce (extend `engine/tests/golden/test_chapterids_golden.py`, I3 expected-from-live). **`node_id` is asserted relational-only — stable within the committed map, opaque, and NEVER equal-to or derived-from any rendered handle** (this clause is what proves BR-021; it forbids the "wrap designation-derived identity in a new object" cheat) | §7.3, F3; D11, D33 | S4.3, S9.2b, **S4.6** | **PLL golden**: rendered handles exact-match + alias resolves; `node_id` relational-only, never handle-derived; no regression | `GATE` (PLL golden) | `TODO` |

### S11 — Pre-translation smoke + post-build evaluation (diagnostic, **not** a ship gate)

S11.0 is the product-safety checkpoint before M4c consumes the v2 Italian; S11.1/S11.2 are
the post-build academic comparison. None has a pass/fail threshold and none must ever become
one (`feedback_no_cheating_results`). The engine writes reports under
`books/per_la_liberta/work/`; it reads v1 artifacts and the review-phase ground truth
**read-only** from the live tree (reading the live tree is allowed; writing it is not).

| ID | Deliverable | Refs | Deps | Done-when (tier) | Tag | St |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S11.0 | **Pre-translation whole-book smoke + human-ack** (gate-less product-safety checkpoint). Before M4c consumes the v2 Italian, produce a **no-threshold** report of v2-introduced *novel* deviations (S11.2's sampled false-change measurement, pulled forward). Build the artifact and **hand it to Ben** (`feedback_human_validation_step`) — never auto-threshold. The acknowledgement is an **artifact keyed to the v2-source lineage hash**; re-running extraction (new lineage) invalidates the old ack. **Forward dependency:** M4c hard-fails with "v2 source smoke not acknowledged for this lineage" when missing/stale — that *enforcement* lands when M4c is ported, not in this axis | user request (product safety); §3; `feedback_human_validation_step` | S3, S10.1 | a written novel-deviation report + a lineage-keyed ack artifact; **no threshold** | `SCAF` (checkpoint) | `TODO` |
| S11.1 | v1↔v2 difference characterization: best-effort align the v2 extracted/reconstructed Italian against v1 `[live] output/italian_clean.md` (fuzzy / node-aligned — **not** 1:1, since segmentation differs by design) and report divergences by class (spaces/fragments reconstructed, word-form changes, structural shifts) + counts | user request (academic comparison); §3 (S3 changes text by design) | S3, S4.6, S10.1 | a written report enumerating divergence classes + counts | `SCAF` (diagnostic) | `TODO` |
| S11.2 | **Accuracy vs the deviation-review ground truth:** for each scan-confirmed deviation from the review phase, did v2 extraction *independently* produce the adjudicated-correct form? The ground-truth artifact is **`[live] data/blind_deviations_classified.json`** (master worklist; worked sheet `[live] state/deviation_crops/sheet.html`; items carry a `resolved` field; ≈768 of ≈862 remaining — **in progress**). Report **recall** + a **sampled** v2-introduced-deviation rate. Because the set is in-progress, recall is **recall vs the adjudicated-so-far subset**, and the report **pins the ground-truth snapshot by hash/date** with the unresolved count reported separately — so later adjudication growth (768→0) cannot retroactively rewrite what an old report claimed | user request; `project_deviation_review_state`, `project_blind_read_signal` | S11.1 | a report giving recall vs the snapshot-pinned adjudicated subset + the sampled false-change rate; **no threshold gate** | `SCAF` (diagnostic) | `TODO` |

> Why S11.1/S11.2 are the right yardstick: the review phase already produced a
> **hand-adjudicated, scan-confirmed** set of where v1's OCR/cleanup went wrong. Measuring
> whether the new geometry + Zipf-DP + oracle extraction *independently* lands the same
> corrections is a far stronger academic signal than diffing two texts that were never 1:1.

## Axis-level Definition of Done — two tiers

The earlier single eight-point DoD over-weighted the generic substrate and let the hardest
book-specific artifact (S4.6) and a product-facing relation (S7.2) slip. It is split into two
tiers so "ready for *what*?" is honest: **Tier A** is the engine-agnostic mechanism, provable
now on synthetic + differ fixtures; **Tier B** is the populated PLL-v2 instance, parts of
which are legitimately `BLOCK`ed on the v2 English. A green Tier A with a blocked Tier B is a
**true** state, not a contradiction — and the Milestone map's two-axis rollup shows it.

**Method gate (every task, both tiers — red-first, PLAN §9).** No task is `DONE` until its
invariants are enumerated in the test-module docstring (`Invariants (proven red below)`) **and each
has a test observed red on violation** — TDD for new code; a permanent negative/planted-violation
test for a guard over existing code (never a throwaway probe). A test whose only red-input is
editing its own literal (or a stdlib bug) is a tautology, not a check. This is the standing fix for
the three audits that each recovered a green-but-unbound test after the fact (S0.1 version
tautology, S0.3 unbound generator, the symlink guard with no negative control); worked examples are
the S0.1–S0.3 test-module docstrings.

### Tier A — Substrate ready (engine-agnostic mechanism)

1. **Raw floor** — the model-level byte-exact raw round-trip passes (S1.2) **and** the
   **production-stream round-trip** reconstructs each real witness through the public read
   path, with the capture-completeness + span-topology invariants (S1.4).
2. **D18 schema born** — the depth-0 / designation-string / non-ordinal second-structure
   fixture validates the schema (S4.5).
3. **D18 generality proven** — that **same** adversarial fixture travels
   recognition→atoms→projections→adapter from raw under an Italian-free core (S9.4).
4. **Re-bind proven** — geometry + fuzzy fingerprint re-attach binds correctly, **fails
   loud** on ambiguity, the threshold is calibrated on a labeled truth set, and the
   monotone-strictness property holds across geometry modes (S5).
5. **Alignment mechanism durable** — cross-language alignment is an L3 relation over
   `node_id`/`SpanRef` (not a reused index), proven on the M:N + partial-span synthetic
   fixture, and **a harness consumes the relation key** (S7.2a).
6. **Governance live** — the structure map is the regen-guarded, stale-fail source of truth;
   the negative battery is green with no skip-masking (S5.2, S8); **all three persisted
   layers (atom-store S1.5, structure-map S4.4, relation-store S7.1c) plus the
   resource/normalizer versions (S3.0) are independently versioned in lineage** with their
   own stale classes.
7. **Scale honored** — structure ops stay sub-quadratic to the design ceiling **including
   serialize/load/index time** (S4.7, D35).
8. **Neutrality holds** — core `structure/` carries no language/structure literal; all book
   opinion is in the profile + structure map (S0.2, S9).

### Tier B — PLL-v2 input ready (populated instance; parts BLOCKED on v2-EN)

9. **No regression** — the PLL golden reproduces current chapter boundaries + every
   **rendered** identity (handles + aliases), with `node_id` relational-only (S10.4).
10. **PLL container map** complete + reviewed + re-bindable, embedded-letter placement pinned
    (S4.6).
11. **Alignment instance populated** — the IT↔EN `alignment_set` over real v2 nodes (S7.2b).
    **`BLOCK` on v2-EN** until the v2 translation exists.
12. **Pre-translation source smoke acknowledged** for the v2-source lineage (S11.0); the M4c
    enforcement hook lands when M4c is ported.

S11.1/S11.2 (academic v1↔v2 comparison) run *after* Tier A+B are met and a v2 extraction
exists — diagnostics that report how the new techniques did, **not** ship gates.

## Cross-track relationships

- **Engine-framework port milestones** (separate `engine-framework` line, `project_engine_framework_fork`):
  this axis is the deepened **M7 (extraction)** territory; **M4c (translate + refine)** is
  paused behind it. S10.2's triage migration sits on top of the **M4b** triage/cleanup that
  already landed — the adapter (S10.1) is what keeps M4b green during the cutover.
- **Forward dependency on M3b (engine typeset port):** the renderer port **must consume S7.2
  alignment (not a paragraph index)** — the tracked cross-track obligation this axis raises.
  This axis ships the alignment mechanism + a harness consumer (S7.2a); the renderer itself is
  M3b's to migrate. (Distinct from the live `[live] typeset.py:609` deploy-hold patch, which
  is an operational fix on the live edition.)
- **Forward dependency on M4c (translate port):** the S11.0 pre-translation-smoke
  *enforcement* ("v2 source smoke not acknowledged for this lineage" → hard fail) lands when
  M4c is ported; this axis builds the report + the lineage-keyed ack artifact.
- **Branch register** (`docs/decisions/branch_register.md`): S9.2b **resolves BR-021** and
  **supersedes BR-019 / BR-020**; record the closure there when it lands.
- **Live PLL is evidence, not target for fixes** — `[live] typeset.py:609` (S7.2) and the
  `[live]` `corrections.json` anchor tombstone (S5.1) are cited as design evidence
  (`feedback_existing_path_failures_as_evidence`); their *operational* fixes belong to the
  deploy-hold track, not this branch.

## Deferred ledger (carried, not tasks)

| Item | State | Revisit condition |
|---|---|---|
| **O2** — recognition packaging (profile read by core vs thin `StructurePlugin` class) | deferred by choice | settles at S9.1 implementation |
| **O3** — HITL scale **ceiling** (the human container-authoring surface) | deferred by choice | only if a real corpus stresses the HITL **container** surface; the *algorithmic* scale of D35 is **now tested** (S4.7), distinct from this human-surface ceiling |
| **O4 / D32** — overlapping / interleaved hierarchy | parked | a target needs discontiguous interleaving (Hamlet) or geometrically-parallel marginalia; reserved `participates-in` hook only (S7.3b) |
| **O5** — mutation-testing tool (the mechanical form of §9 red-first) | deferred by choice; manual invariant-targeted sweep used now | revisit at **S1.5** (first persisted store = first real logic worth mutating): stand up **cosmic-ray** in an isolated worktree, decide gate-vs-on-demand on data |
| **O6** — geometric layout / bbox provider feeding concern A | scanned 2026-06-26; not adopted | revisit when **concern A's atom/block model is real (S1–S2)** and a *second book* motivates auto-layout — lead candidate **kraken**, behind an optional extraction-side provider seam, never in core |

### Deferred-ledger scan notes (2026-06-26)

Captured for the record from two tool scans run this session; both are *information*, not commitments.

- **O5 — mutation testing on Python 3.13.** The lightweight tools are dead on 3.13: `mutmut` 2.x crashes at startup (`pony`/pickle), `mutatest` crashes on the first trial (`random.sample` on a set, removed in 3.11 — it does find 22 targets in `paths.py` first). Only two execute trials on 3.13: `mutmut` 3.x (project-copy model; fought our `src/` layout — its stats phase collected the full `tests/` against a partial copy → `ModuleNotFoundError: engine.lang`) and **cosmic-ray** 8.4.6 (ran 156 mutants on `paths.py` to completion — but heavyweight: a fresh pytest subprocess per mutant, and it **leaves the source file dirty if interrupted** → only ever run it in an isolated git worktree). On today's declarations-only `structure/` surface, mutation testing has almost nothing to bite (`mutatest` found **0** targets there; only `mutmut` mutates bare literals, mapping exactly to the two known-deferred version non-pinnings + the F3 equivalent mutant). Until S1.5 the discipline is the manual invariant-targeted sweep (one mutation per enumerated invariant) — see PLAN §9.
- **O6 — book-layout bbox tools.** A layout provider would automate what PLL already hand-tuned (`typography.json`/verse, header-strip regex, page-citation mapping) — low marginal value for PLL, real value only for onboarding a *second* book book-agnostically, so it belongs behind an optional extraction-side provider seam (like the OCR backends / the spaCy extra), never as an `engine/` core dependency. Clean, Py-3.13-native, permissively-licensed candidates: **kraken** (Apache-2.0, historical-scan-native, regions + baselines + reading order → lead), **Docling / docling-layout-heron** (MIT, but DocLayNet classes → no verse/marginalia, degrades on historical type), **PaddleOCR / PP-StructureV3** (Apache-2.0, richest taxonomy, heavy `paddlepaddle` stack). **Eynollah** has the only native marginalia / drop-cap-initial / header classes but is TensorFlow<2.13 / Py 3.8–3.11 / Linux-only → containerized, off our path. **Avoid:** layoutparser + dhSegment (unmaintained), marker (GPL), DocLayout-YOLO / Ultralytics-YOLO (AGPL network-copyleft). Caveats: no surveyed tool types "verse"; no benchmark exists on a 1913 Bodoni Italian book; all drag in torch/TF/paddle (hundreds of MB). Maturity figures web-verified by the scan agent this session, not re-checked per-repo.

## § Audit log

### S3 ↔ golden — RESOLVED (2026-06-26)

The first audit flagged S3 (space/fragment reconstruction) as orphaned in the DAG and the
graph parenthetical "(PLL golden also needs S3)" as inconsistent with `S10.4`'s deps.
**Resolution (user-confirmed):** "no regression" means **structural fidelity, not
byte-identical text** — v2 is *allowed and intended* to read better than v1 where S3 recovers
split/fragmented words the live pipeline never reconstructed. So the PLL golden (S10.4)
validates **structure** (boundaries + identities) and gains **no** S3 dependency; S3 is
pinned by its **own** space-recon tier (S3.2) + the raw round-trip floor (S1.2/S1.4), feeding
the v2 **instance**, not the regression golden. **Added on top:** an academic, post-build
v1↔v2 comparison (**S11.1/S11.2**) that measures the new extraction's accuracy against the
review-phase scan-confirmed deviation set — diagnostic only, never a gate. _Thread struck._

### Multi-round adversarial audit (Codex × Claude) — RESOLVED + FOLDED (2026-06-26)

A three-round adversarial audit (Codex red-team ↔ Claude rebuttal, plus Claude's independent
M1–M8 pass) converged with no open contentions; every outcome is folded into the task tables,
the two-tier DoD, the Milestone map two-axis rollup, and the Test-tiers glossary above. The
**verbatim threads** (`======`/`@@@@@@`, `=====!`/`@@@@@!`, `====!!`/`@@@@!!`) are archived in
**`ENGINE_STRUCTURE_TASKS_DISCUSSION.md`**. _Threads struck._ The landing sites:

fold resolved outcomes into the affected task + spec section, record the landing in the
ledger, then move the verbatim thread to the discussion archive.)_
